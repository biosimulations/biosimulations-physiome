Gate initialization
-------------------

The `gate_initials.cellml <../components/gate_initials.cellml>`_ computes the initial values of m, n and h based on the value of membrane potential :math:`V`, while the `gate_steady.cellml <../components/gate_steady.cellml>`_ defines the equation of steady state values of m, n and h gates.
This component is imported by experimental models and parameterised according to the experiment settings.
