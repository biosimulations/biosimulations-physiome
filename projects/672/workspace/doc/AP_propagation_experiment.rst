Action potential propagation along 1D cable model
--------------------------------------------------

In the `action potential propagation experiment  <../experiments/AP_propagation_experiment.cellml>`_, the `propagated action potential model <../components/propagated_AP.cellml/view>`_ is configured and parameterised to simulate an action potential propagating along 1D cable. 

You can modify the parameters of temperature :math:`T` and initial depolarization :math:`V_{initial}`  in the component ``parameters`` and ``initial_conditions``, respectively.

The simulation experiment can be obtained by loading the `corresponding SED-ML document <../sed-ml/AP_propagation_experiment.sedml>`__ into OpenCOR and executing the simulation.
