In this workspace we have the `Scaffold Maker <https://github.com/ABI-Software/scaffoldmaker>`_ workflow and configuration files needed to produce the mouse lung scaffold for the `SPARC <https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc>`_ project.

The rat lung scaffold was independently designed based on generic anatomical structures containing different cube, wedge and tetrahedron elements. As the anatomical structure of the lungs varies in each species, the lung scaffolds are capable of representing the characteristics of an individual lung in various species accurately. For instance, the lung scaffolds were fitted and smoothed to the segmented datasets from a rat (NeuroRat V4.0; DOI: 10.13099/VIP91106-04-0). These scaffolds can also be used to register and map various data such as neural network, blood vessel, ventilation, etc.

Please see the `SPARC Portal <https://sparc.science>`_ for more details about the SPARC project.
