Slow delayed rectifier potassium current (:math:`I_Ks`) model optimization
****************************************************************************

The voltage dependent activation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and two other independent datasets
from `Ma et al. (2015)`_ in order to optimize data specific model. Parameters in all models were
parameterized using the activation time constants from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ (Fig. 7. B).


`act_inact.cellml`_ is the main CellML file which shows the probability of
transient outward potassium channel being open or\
close. Its associated SED-ML file contains all the simulation settings.
All the CellML files and SED-ML files need to be download in a same folder (act_inact, gating, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig7-new.py`_). In the python script, required SED-ML file is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. `fig7-new.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 7 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 7, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig7-new.py
