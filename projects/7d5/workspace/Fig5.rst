Rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (:math:`I_Kr`) model optimization
****************************************************************************

The voltage dependent activation and inactivation gating variables were modeled here.
The single exponential voltage‚Äêdependent rate constant model
was optimized to fit the voltage dependence of :math:`I_Kr` inactivation in the `ten
Tusscher 2004 model`_. The result of inactivation gating is shown in Fig. 5 A and D.
Activation gating model were fit to four different data for multiple labs; `Ma et al. (2011)`_,
`Garg et al. (2018)`_, `Bellin et al. (2013)`_ and `Es-Salah-Lamoureux et al. (2016)`_.
Parameters in `Ma et al. (2011)`_, `Garg et al. (2018)`_ and `Es-Salah-Lamoureux et al. (2016)`_.
model, were optimized using the time constant activation of `Ma et al. (2011)`_. Time
constant activation in `Bellin et al. (2013)`_ were used in the model. (Fig. 5 C)


`act_inact.cellml`_ is the main CellML file which show the probability of
potassium channel being open or\
close. Its associated SED-ML file contains all the simulation settings.
All the CellML files and SED-ML files need to be download in a same folder (act_inact, gating, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig5-new.py`_). In the python script, required SED-ML file is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. fig5-new.py is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 5 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 5, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig5-new.py
