The voltage dependent activation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and Kurokawa Lab `Li et al. (2017)`_
in order to optimize data specific model. Activation gate parameters were
optimized using the steady-state activation and activation time constants from experimental data
(Fig. 8. A and B).


`act_inact.cellml`_ is the main CellML file which shows the probability of
transient outward potassium channel being open or\
close. Its associated SED-ML file contains all the simulation settings.
All the CellML files and SED-ML files need to be download in a same folder (act_inact, gating, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig8-new.py`_). In the python script, required SED-ML file is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. `fig8-new.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 8 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 8, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig8-new.py
