Transient outward potassium current (:math:`I_to`) model optimization
****************************************************************************
The voltage dependent activation and inactivation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_, `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_
and `Veerman et al. (2016)`_ in order to optimize data specific model.
Since non of the datasets had both steady-state activation and inactivation data therefore,
Inactivation time constant parameters of `Veerman et al. (2016)`_ model were optimized with time
constant activation from `Ma et al. (2011)`_. `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_ model parameters were optimized
with steady-state activation parameters from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and steady-state inactivation
data from `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_ were used to optimize the model of `Ma et al. (2011)`_. All the
results are presented in Fig. 6. D.
Time constant activation parameters were optimized to `ten Tusscher (2004)`_ model which is shown
in Fig. 6 C.


`act_inact.cellml`_ is the main CellML file which shows the probability of
transient outward potassium channel being open or\
close. Its associated SED-ML file contains all the simulation settings.
All the CellML files and SED-ML files need to be download in a same folder (act_inact, gating, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig6-new.py`_). In the python script, required SED-ML file is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. `fig6-new.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 6 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 6, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig6-new.py
