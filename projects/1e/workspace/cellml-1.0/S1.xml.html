	From this page you can access the CellML model and various other information from the "Views available" menu on the right. This CellML 1.0 version of the S1 simulation experiment was generated from the <a href="../cellml/experiments/S1.xml/view">CellML 1.1 version</a> using Jonathan Cooper's <a href="http://cellml.org/tools">VersionConverter</a> tool. This CellML 1.0 version is provided as a convenience for use in tools which do not support the normative CellML 1.1 version of this model. This generated version of the model loads and runs fine in OpenCell but not COR due to the use of the <code>rem</code> and <code>min</code> MathML operators. There may also be other reasons why this model does not run in COR.
