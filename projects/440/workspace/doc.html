<head><title>Testing linkage between SVG images and CellML/SED-ML documents</title></head>
<body>
<p>Here we are testing some ideas about using COMBINE Archive Manifest files to define the relevant resources in a workspace and then adding annotations to describe the linkage between entities in the SVG image and the CellML models and SED-ML experiments. We will begin with the RDF annotations being in this workspace (and listed in the manifest), but in the general case tools would query PMR for any relevant annotations.</p>
<p>The <a href="periodic-stimulus.sedml/view">SED-ML description</a> of the main simulation experiment is available; as is the <a href="HH-model/experiments/periodic-stimulus.xml/view">main CellML model defining this particular stimulus protocol</a> and the <a href="HH-model/components/stimulated.xml/view">base mathematical model</a>.</p>
