	This is the CellML encoding of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1359535/">1962 Noble</a> cardiac cellular electrophysiology model. This version of the model is self-pacing, as demonstrated in the image below. A result such as this could be published in some journal article somewhere.
