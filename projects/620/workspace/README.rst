In this workspace we have the `Scaffold Maker <https://github.com/ABI-Software/scaffoldmaker>`_ workflow and
configuration files needed to produce the generic rat heart scaffold for the `SPARC <https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc>`_ project.

The heart scaffold consists of separate manifolds to represent different anatomical regions enclosing both the
endocardial and epicardial tissue volumes such as left and right atria, left and right ventricles, pulmonary veins etc.
The rat heart scaffold was calibrated using segmented image data provided from James Schwaberâ€™s lab at the
Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.

Please see the `SPARC Portal <https://sparc.science>`_ for more details about the SPARC project.
