In this workspace we have the `Scaffold Maker <https://github.com/ABI-Software/scaffoldmaker>`_ workflow and configuration files needed to produce the generic human colon scaffold for the `SPARC <https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc>`_ project.

The colon scaffold is designed topologically as a tube defined by a central line which follows the path of a colon traced from an image, which could be obtained from photography, CT or MRI. The scaffold captures the haustral sacs appearance due to presence of three tenia coli.  The colon scaffold's haustra are currently very regular, and are representative rather than matching any individual. The ability to control dimensions such as colon diameter, wall thickness, and tenia coli properties, as well as variations of these properties throughout the entire length of the colon allows the scaffold to be configurable for different center paths and sizes to support different species and individuals. 

The human colon scaffold is created based on average dimensions and images obtained from literature.
