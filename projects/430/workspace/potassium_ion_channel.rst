The HH potassium channel
------------------------

In the tutorial, the `Hodgkin & Huxley potassium channel <potassium_ion_channel.cellml/view>`__ is used as the example illustrating the core concepts of components and connections in CellML. It is also a great example demonstrating the utility of `providing SED-ML alongside the model <potassium_ion_channel.sedml>`__, as shown with the results presented in the figure below.
