<h4>Figure 3A</h4>
<p align="justify">This is the general mathematical model for the <a href="Weinstein_1995_NHE3_Fig3A.cellml"> NHE3 </a> model with modifications to enable simulations which are capable of reproducing Figure 3A in the <a href="http://identifiers.org/doi/10.1085/jgp.105.5.617">original paper</a>. The simulation experiment for this model can be obtained by loading the <a href="Weinstein_1995_NHE3_Fig3A.sedml">corresponding SED-ML document</a> into OpenCOR and executing the simulation. The results of which are shown below. A rendering of the mathematical model itself is available <a href="Weinstein_1995_NHE3.cellml#cellml_math">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">In Figure 3, the Na<sup>+</sup> influx is computed as a function of external Na<sup>+</sup> concentration for different values of external pH when NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is not present. Internal pH is 6 and internal Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is fixed at 0.0 mM. In <i>Figure 3A</i> external pH is 6.6.</p>
