This plugin provides synchronized OpenGL views. All the views react to the mouse actions performed in a view. 
This allows, for instance, to view internal organs, catheters, scopes etc in separate views and in a compound view and orient them.
The rendered structures range from meshes, images and glyphs and can be setup using the OpenCMISS ZINC API.
