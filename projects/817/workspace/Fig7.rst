Pacemaker/funny current (:math:`I_f`) model optimization
****************************************************************************

The voltage dependent activation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and Kurokawa Lab `Li et al. (2017)`_
in order to optimize data specific model. Activation gate parameters were
optimized using the steady-state activation and activation time constants from experimental data
(Fig. 7. A and B). I-V curves for :math:`I_f` (Fig. 7. C).


`Current_If.cellml`_  is the main CellML files which has all the formulation for Pacemaker/funny current,
Its associated Sedml file contains all the simulation settings.

All the CellML files and SED-ML files related to this channel need to be downloaded in a same folder (Current_If, gating_If, parameter_If, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig7.py`_). In the python script, required Sedml file (Current_If.sedml) is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced.`fig7.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 8 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 8, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig7.py
