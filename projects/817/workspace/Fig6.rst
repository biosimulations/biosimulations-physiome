Slow delayed rectifier potassium current (:math:`I_Ks`) model optimization
****************************************************************************

The voltage dependent activation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and two other independent datasets
from `Ma et al. (2015)`_ in order to optimize data specific model.
Steady-state inactivation and activation iPSC-CM experimental data, with optimized dataset-specific models for
different dataset (Fig. 6 A)
Parameters in all models were parameterized using the activation time constants from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ (Fig. 6. B). and I-V curves for
:math:`I_Ks` (Fig. 6. C).


`Current_Iks.cellml`_  is the main CellML files which has all the formulation for slow delayed rectifier potassium current,
Its associated Sedml file contains all the simulation settings.

All the CellML files and SED-ML files related to this channel need to be downloaded in a same folder (Current_Iks, gating_Iks, parameter_Iks, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig6.py`_). In the python script, required Sedml file (Current_Iks.sedml) is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. `fig6.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 7 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 7, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig6.py
