Transient outward potassium current (:math:`I_to`) model optimization
****************************************************************************
The voltage dependent activation and inactivation gating variables were modeled here.
experimental iPSC‚ÄêCM data collected from `Ma et al. (2011)`_, `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_
and `Veerman et al. (2016)`_ in order to optimize data specific model.
Steady-state inactivation and activation iPSC-CM experimental data, with optimized dataset-specific models for
different dataset (Fig. 5 A)
Since non of the datasets had both steady-state activation and inactivation data therefore,
Inactivation time constant parameters of `Veerman et al. (2016)`_ model were optimized with time
constant activation from `Ma et al. (2011)`_. `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_ model parameters were optimized
with steady-state activation parameters from `Ma et al. (2011)`_ and steady-state inactivation
data from `Cordeiro et al. (2013)`_ were used to optimize the model of `Ma et al. (2011)`_. All the
results are presented in Fig. 5. D.
Time constant activation parameters were optimized to `ten Tusscher (2004)`_ model which is shown
in Fig. 5 C. I-V curves for :math:`I_to` (Fig. 5. B).


`Current_Ito.cellml`_  is the main CellML files which has all the formulation for transient outward potassium current,
Its associated Sedml file contains all the simulation settings.

All the CellML files and SED-ML files related to this channel need to be downloaded in a same folder (Current_Ito, gating_Ito, parameter_Ito, parameter, unit)
as well as python script (`fig5.py`_). In the python script, required Sedml file (Current_Ito.sedml) is loaded
into the script and by running the code following figure is reproduced. `fig5.py`_ is used to
generate the simulation and reproduces the graph shown in Figure 6 in the original study.
In order to reproduce Figure 6, once all the files are downloaded to the same folder,
execute the following script from the command line (command prompt):

cd [PathToThisFile]

[PathToOpenCOR]/pythonshell fig5.py
