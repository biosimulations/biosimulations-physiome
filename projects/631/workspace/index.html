<body>
<p>
The model was implemented based on the original Matlab code provided by the
author. The derivatives were calculated for the original implementation and
this version, and matched to within 17 digits. The code can be run to produce
an AP similar to that seen in the original paper.

<p>The stimulus was set to 0.5ms and -8000pA.</p>
