<p>
The glucose-induced switch between glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase in the liver is 
investigated by means of a theoretical approach based on a minimal, bicyclic cascade model involving 
the reversible phosphorylation of the two enzymes. The aim of the analysis is to evaluate the 
contribution of diï¬€erent factors to the sequential changes in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase and 
glycogen synthase observed following the addition of suprathreshold amounts of glucose.
