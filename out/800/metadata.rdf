    <dc:description>About this model
This is a bond-graph model of cardiac contraction in the human cardiomyocyte.

INPUTS:

Intracellular calcium transient [Ca]i

OUTPUTS:

Tension generated by sarcomere

REACTIONS:

Re.TRPN_Ca: Binding of Ca to troponin (TRPN)
Re.BU: Spontaneous switching of crossbridge from B (blocked) to U (unbound) states
Re.UW: Spontaneous switching of crossbridge from U to W (pre-powerstroke) states
Re.WS: Spontaneous switching of crossbridge from W to S (powerstroke) states
Re.SU: Spontaneous switching of crossbridge from S to U states

Model status
The current CellML implementation runs in OpenCOR.

Model overview
This model is based on existing kinetic models, where the mathematics are translated into the bond-graph formalism. This describes the model in energetic terms and forces adherence to the laws of thermodynamics.
For the following bond-graphs, all enzymes are shown in maroon.
A '0' node refers to a junction where all chemical potentials are the same. A '1' node refers to all fluxes being the same going in and out of the junction.

Biochemical reactions
For reaction TRPN_Ca, the rate of Ca unbinding from TRPN is tension dependent. The term was fitted with an exponential function, which is then used as a transformer TF in the resultant bond-graph.

Tension generation
For differential terms involving tension and displacement, a mass-spring-damper system was used to approximate the model in order to enable translation into bond-graph mathematics.
Length terms were dimensionalised through the resting sarcomere length SL_0, and quantities of crossbridge units were dimensionalised through the estimated number of myosin binding sites per sarcomere.
Total tension is the sum of passive and active tension components. The total tension is then fed as an input into Re:TRPN_Ca.
Active tension

Fig. 2. Bond-graph formulations for distortion states, leading to calculation of active tension (Ta). Each of the three equations are modelled as a 1 node, with sum of potentials of the bonds equalling zero.

Passive tension

Fig. 3. Bond-graph formulations of strain and extension contributing to passive tension (Fd). Each of the three equations are modelled as a 1 node, with sum of potentials of the bonds equalling zero.

Total tension

Parameter finding
A description of the process to find bond-graph parameters is shown in the folder    parameter_finder, which relies on the:

stoichiometry of system
kinetic constants for forward/reverse reactions

If not already, all reactions are made reversible by assigning a small value to the reverse  direction.

linear algebra script.

Here, this solve process is performed in Python.
