#### Model Status



 This CellML model has been validated. Due to the differences between procedural code (in this case C-code) and 
 declarative languages (CellML), some aspects of the original model were not able to be encapsulated by the CellML 
 model (such as the damping of variables). This may effect the transient behaviour of the model, however the 
 steady-state behaviour would remain the same. The equations in this file and the steady-state output from 
 the model conform to the results from the MODSIM program.
 


#### Model Structure



Arthur Guyton (1919-2003) was an American physiologist who became famous for his 1950s experiments in which he studied the 
physiology of cardiac output and its relationship with the peripheral circulation. The results of these experiments 
challenged the conventional wisdom that it was the heart itself that controlled cardiac output. Instead Guyton demonstrated 
that it was the need of the body tissues for oxygen which was the real regulator of cardiac output. The "Guyton Curves" 
describe the relationship between right atrial pressures and cardiac output, and they form a foundation for understanding 
the physiology of circulation. 




The Guyton model of fluid, electrolyte, and circulatory regulation is an extensive mathematical model of human circulatory 
physiology, capable of simulating a variety of experimental conditions, and contains a number of linked subsystems relating 
to circulation and its neuroendocrine control.




This is a CellML translation of the Guyton model of the regulation of the circulatory system. The complete model consists 
of separate modules each of which characterise a separate physiological subsystems. The Circulation Dynamics is the primary 
system, to which other modules/blocks are connected. The other modules characterise the dynamics of the kidney, electrolytes 
and cell water, thirst and drinking, hormone regulation, autonomic regulation, cardiovascular system etc, and these feedback 
on the central circulation model. The CellML code in these modules is based on the C code from the programme C-MODSIM created 
by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.




The tissues of the body are divided into non-muscle tissues and muscle tissues, and the delivery of oxygen to each one of these 
is calculated separately. The principal reason for this separation is that during muscle activity, the delivery of oxygen to 
the muscles increases tremendously and correspondingly affects the blood flow through the muscles. This particular CellML model 
describes the delivery of oxygen to the muscle, and several aspects of local cellular usage of oxygen are also calculated. 




There are several publications referring to the Guyton model. One of these papers is cited below:
