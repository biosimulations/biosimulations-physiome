    <dc:description>Model Status

            This model has been curated and unit checked by Alan Garny in collaboration with the model authors and it is known to run in COR to reproduce the published results.  It also works in JSim as long as the stimulus protocol is altered. 
          
Model Structure

Different types of ion channel, with their distinct gating and conductance properties, play a unique role in generating membrane excitation.  Although the behaviours of single ion channels have been extensively studied experimentally, ionic current interactions make it difficult to deduce their individual roles in membrane excitability.  In order to better understand the roles of the individual ion currents, Satoshi Matsuoka et al. have developed a mathematical model of membrane excitation for the ventricular cell. 


The Matsuoka et al. mathematical model is a development of previously published cardiac cellular models.  The group's general approach to modelling was based on the methods used in the Difrancesco-Noble, 1985 Model and the Luo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994.  In addition, the compound Kyoto Model of Matsuoka et al. incorporates the Negroni and Lascano (1996) model of cardiac muscle contraction, allowing simulation of sarcomere shortening, and also, the gating model of Shirokov et al. is used for both the fast Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels.

New experimental data are included, such as new kinetics of the inward rectifier K+ channel, the delayed rectifier K+ channel, and the sustained inward current (for more details on the reaction kinetics, see figure 3 below).  Model simulations showed that ion conductance by the L-type Ca2+ channel (ICaL) dominates the membrane conductance during the action potential.  Repolarisation occurs as the following currents are sequentially activated: IKs; IKr; and IK1.  Agreement between model simulation results and experimental data was taken as supporting evidence for the validity of the model.
