#### Model Status



 This CellML model has been validated. Due to the differences between procedural code (in this case C-code) 
 and declarative languages (CellML), some aspects of the original model were not able to be encapsulated by 
 the CellML model (such as the damping of variables). This may effect the transient behaviour of the model, 
 however the steady-state behaviour would remain the same. The equations in this file and the steady-state 
 output from the model conform to the results from the MODSIM program. 
 


#### Model Structure



Arthur Guyton (1919-2003) was an American physiologist who became famous for his 1950s experiments in which he studied 
the physiology of cardiac output and its relationship with the peripheral circulation. The results of these experiments 
challenged the conventional wisdom that it was the heart itself that controlled cardiac output. Instead Guyton demonstrated 
that it was the need of the body tissues for oxygen which was the real regulator of cardiac output. The "Guyton Curves" 
describe the relationship between right atrial pressures and cardiac output, and they form a foundation for understanding 
the physiology of circulation. 




The Guyton model of fluid, electrolyte, and circulatory regulation is an extensive mathematical model of human circulatory 
physiology, capable of simulating a variety of experimental conditions, and contains a number of linked subsystems relating 
to circulation and its neuroendocrine control.




This is a CellML translation of the Guyton model of the regulation of the circulatory system. The complete model consists 
of separate modules each of which characterise a separate physiological subsystems. The Circulation Dynamics is the primary 
system, to which other modules/blocks are connected. The other modules characterise the dynamics of the kidney, electrolytes 
and cell water, thirst and drinking, hormone regulation, autonomic regulation, cardiovascular system etc, and these feedback 
on the central circulation model. The CellML code in these modules is based on the C code from the programme C-MODSIM created 
by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.




This particular CellML model describes the control of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion by the left and right atria of 
the heart. It also calculates a multiplier factor for controlling the resistance of the afferent arterioles (AAR) of the kidneys.




There are several publications referring to the Guyton model. One of these papers is cited below:
