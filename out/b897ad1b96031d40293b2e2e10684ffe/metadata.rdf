    <dc:description>#### Model Status



 This CellML model has not been validated. The equations in this file may contain errors and the output from the model may not 
 conform to the results from the MODSIM program. Due to the differences between procedural code (in this case C-code) and 
 declarative languages (CellML), some aspects of the original model were not able to be encapsulated by the CellML model (such 
 as the damping of variables). Work is underway to fix these omissions and validate the CellML model. We also anticipate that 
 many of these problems will be fixed when the CellML 1.0 models are combined in a CellML 1.1 format.
 


#### Model Structure



Arthur Guyton (1919-2003) was an American physiologist who became famous for his 1950s experiments in which he studied the physiology 
of cardiac output and its relationship with the peripheral circulation. The results of these experiments challenged the conventional 
wisdom that it was the heart itself that controlled cardiac output. Instead Guyton demonstrated that it was the need of the body tissues 
for oxygen which was the real regulator of cardiac output. The "Guyton Curves" describe the relationship between right atrial pressures 
and cardiac output, and they form a foundation for understanding the physiology of circulation. 




The Guyton model of fluid, electrolyte, and circulatory regulation is an extensive mathematical model of human circulatory physiology, 
capable of simulating a variety of experimental conditions, and contains a number of linked subsystems relating to circulation and its 
neuroendocrine control.




This is a CellML translation of the Guyton model of the regulation of the circulatory system. The complete model consists of separate 
modules each of which characterise a separate physiological subsystems. The Circulation Dynamics is the primary system, to which other 
modules/blocks are connected. The other modules characterise the dynamics of the kidney, electrolytes and cell water, thirst and 
drinking, hormone regulation, autonomic regulation, cardiovascular system etc, and these feedback on the central circulation model. 
The CellML code in these modules is based on the C code from the programme C-MODSIM created by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.




This particular CellML model describes the function of the kidney. This section is a highly simplified analysis of renal function, 
including analysis of blood flow through the kidney and of the formation of glomerular filtrate. Then the changes that occur in the 
filtrate as it passes through the tubules are calculated. However, only four substances are considered as they pass through the 
tubules: sodium, potassium, urea, and water. The control effects of angiotensin, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and nervous 
signals are also presented. 




There are several publications referring to the Guyton model. One of these papers is cited below:
