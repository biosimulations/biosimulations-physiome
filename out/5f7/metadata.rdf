### Model Status



 This model has been encoded using the information available in the [published article](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00353.2001).
 Only the nodal part of the model has been implemented:
 


* No equation to compute the membrane potential is provided.
 However, the model relies on the [Hodgkin-Huxley formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model#Voltage-gated_ion_channels), so we rely on that formulation to compute the membrane potential.
 We use `Cn` as the capacitance and `iNaf`, `iNap`, `iKs` and `iLk` as the currents involved in the membrane dynamics.
 We also use `iKf`, but by default its conductance is set to `0 S/cm2`.
 The authors mention that, based on experimental data, the value for `gKf` should be about `0.02 S/cm2`, hence they tested their model using a range of values between `0.01` and `0.04 S/cm2`.
* No initial values for the membrane potential (`Vm`) and the different gating variables (`m`, `h`, `p`, `s` and `n`) are provided.
 So, we set `Vm` to `-80 mV` (i.e. the resting potential used in the internodal segments) and the different gating variables to `0`.
 From there, the model was run without any stimulus and for several days worth of simulation to reach steady state.
* No information about the kind of stimulus that should be applied to generate a default action potential is provided.
 However, various stimulus durations are mentioned in the published article, varying between `0.1` and `3 ms`.
 So, we arbitrarily went for `0.5 ms`.
 As for the stimulus amplitude, we went for the smallest value that yields an action potential (actually, a series of action potentials), i.e. `0.05 mA/cm2`.
 (A stimulus amplitude of `0.04 mA/cm2` will just result in a blip.)</dc:description>
