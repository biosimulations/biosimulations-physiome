### Model status


The current CellML implementation runs in [OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/).
The results have been validated against the data extracted from the figures in the published [Bursztyn, Limor, et al (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267547/). We provide the settings used for the figure reproduction with the simulation results shown under Experiments. The model structure can be found in the documentation of Components. The curation process has been summarized in the [Model history](#model-history) and [Known issues](#known-issues).




### Model overview


This workspace holds a [CellML](https://www.cellml.org/) encoding of the [Bursztyn, Limor, et al (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267547/) model.
The [Bursztyn, Limor, et al (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267547/) paper describes three *Ca*2 + control mechanisms: voltage-operated *Ca*2 + channels, *Ca*2 + pumps and *Na*+ ⁄ *Ca*2 + exchangers, which employ the mathematical formulation proposed in [Parthimos, Dimitris et al (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.1999.277.3.H1119). The cross-bridge model of [Hai and Murphy (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.1988.254.1.C99) is used to describe the processes of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and stress production, which is essentially a deterministic multi-state Markov model (MM).

### Modular description



#### Components


CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:


* [Excitation-contraction component](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Components/EC_uSMC.cellml), including:

	+ [Nernst potential computation](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/cellLib/Components/Nernst_potential.cellml)
	+ [Four-stage cross-bridge model (CB4HM)](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/cellLib/Components/CB4HM.cellml)
	+ [Ions fluxes component](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Components/J_Ca.cellml)
* [Ions fluxes component](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Components/J_Ca.cellml), including:

	+ L-type voltage dependent *Ca*2 + channels *J**VOCC*, and the computation of current reuses the imported ionic current components
	+ the efflux through *Ca*2 + pump *J**Ca*, *pump*
	+ the flux through the *Na*+ ⁄ *Ca*2 + exchangers *J**Na* ⁄ *Ca*
* [Excitation-contraction unit](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Components/Unit_uSMC.cellml), which decouples the connection between the excitation and contraction. This is used to test individual ion fluxes and contraction development.


Each of these blocks is itself a CellML model, which enables us to reuse the various components in future studies and models.




#### Experiments


Following best practices, this model separates the mathematics from the parameterisation of the model. The mathematical model is imported into a specific parameterised instance in order to perform numerical simulations.
The parameterisation would include defining the stimulus protocol to be applied.


This workspace has seven sets of experiments and corresponding simulation results:


1. [Single stimulation experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Single_stim_experiment.cellml/view)
2. [Multiple stimulation experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Multi_stim_experiment.cellml/view)
3. [Voltage ramp experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Vramp_experiment.cellml/view)
4. [Membrane potential simulation experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Vm_stim_experiment.cellml/view)
5. [Sodium concentration experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Nai_experiment.cellml/view)
6. [Calcium concentration experiment 1](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Cai_experiment1.cellml/view)
7. [Calcium concentration experiment 2](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Cai_experiment2.cellml)




#### Simulation settings


Simulation settings are encoded in [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org/) documents for experiment execution. It is common that we may need to vary experimental settings to obtain data under various conditions. Hence, the full experimental settings are encoded in the simulation scripts.
The Python scripts to run simulation and reproduce the figures in the original paper are included under the Simulation folder. The name of the simulation and plot scripts
indicates the Figure number in the primary paper. For example, Fig2\_sim.py is used to generate the simulation data and Fig2\_plot.py reproduces the graph shown in Figure 2 in the primary paper.





### Model history


There is no publicly available code for this model.




### Known issues


1. During curation process, we noticed trivial typographical errors in parameter units and references in Table 3 of [Bursztyn, Limor, et al (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267547/). Hence, we correct
these in Table 4 to remove potential confusion.

2. We have summarized experiment settings along with simulation results, providing more details that were not included in the primary paper.

### Multiple stimulation experiment


In the [Multiple stimulation experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Experiments/Experiments/Multi_stim_experiment.cellml/view), the [Excitation-contraction component](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Components/EC_uSMC.cellml) is configured and parameterised with an applied [multiple pulses patch clamp protocol](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/cellLib/Protocols/Patch_clamp_protocol.cellml).


You can change the parameters of stimulation in the component Vstim\_para.


You can also bypass the parameters in the component model\_parameters and initial\_conditions and define your own parameters. We defined control\_para to alter some parameters such as intracellular *Na*+ concentration, inhibition of *Ca*2 + pumps control *inhPump*, for specific experiments.


The simulation experiment can be obtained by loading the [corresponding SED-ML document](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Simulation/Multi_stim_experiment.sedml) into OpenCOR and executing the simulation.




### The model reaction to a train of pulse potentials


We parameterise the multiple pulses patch clamp protocol to generate a train of 10 voltage pulses of 100 ms duration from a holding potential of −80 mV to a pulse potential of 0 mV, with an interval of 330 ms between the pulses.
Figure [[1]](#id3) shows the model *Ca*2 +*i* to the train of pulse potentials.

In addition, the component Nai is defined to generate a linear *Na*+*i* profile from 1 mM to 46 mM.


You can change the parameters of stimulation in the component Vstim\_para, while -50 mV holding voltage is used for Figure 8B.


You can also bypass the parameters in the component model\_parameters and initial\_conditions and define your own parameters. We defined control\_para to alter some parameters such as *Ca*2 +*i* for this specific experiment.


The simulation experiment can be obtained by loading the [corresponding SED-ML document](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/742/Simulation/Nai_experiment.sedml) into OpenCOR and executing the simulation.
