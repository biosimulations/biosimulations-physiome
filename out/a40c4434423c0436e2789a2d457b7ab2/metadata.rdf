#### Model Structure


ABSTRACT: The guinea-pig ventricular cell model, originally developed by Noble et al in 1991, has been greatly extended to include accumulation and depletion of calcium in a diadic space between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum where, according to contempory understanding, the majority of calcium-induced calcium release is triggered. The calcium in this space is also assumed to play the major role in calcium-induced inactivation of the calcium current. Delayed potassium current equations have been developed to include the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed rectifier current based on the data of of Heath and Terrar, along with data from Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz. Length- and tension-dependent changes in mechanical and electrophysiological processes have been incorporated as described recently by Kohl et al. Drug receptor interactions have started to be developed, using the sodium channel as the first target. The new model has been tested against experimental data on action potential clamp, and on force-interval and duration-interval relations; it has been found to reliably reproduce experimental observations.

#### Model Status



This version has been curated and unit-checked by Penny Noble and is known to run in PCEnv and COR. This is the EXTENDED model, which includes everything from the BASIC variant and also acetylcholine dependent modulation and contraction modelling, but not stretch and fibroblast simulation. This model is parameterised the same as the BASIC model, with all additional variables set to zero. The values for these variables can be found in [Noble et al.'s 1998 paper.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9487284&amp;dopt=Abstract)
This model also has a PCEnv session file associated with it.
