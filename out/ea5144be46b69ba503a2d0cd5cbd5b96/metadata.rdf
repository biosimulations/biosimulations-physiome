    <dc:description>Model Status

        This CellML model has been validated. Due to the differences between procedural code (in this case C-code) and 
		declarative languages (CellML), some aspects of the original model were not able to be encapsulated by the CellML 
		model (such as the damping of variables). This may effect the transient behaviour of the model, however the 
		steady-state behaviour would remain	the same. The equations in this file and the steady-state output from the model 
		conform to the results from the MODSIM program.
	
Model Structure

Arthur Guyton (1919-2003) was an American physiologist who became famous for his 1950s experiments in which he studied the 
physiology of cardiac output and its relationship with the peripheral circulation.  The results of these experiments 
challenged the conventional wisdom that it was the heart itself that controlled cardiac output.  Instead Guyton demonstrated 
that it was the need of the body tissues for oxygen which was the real regulator of cardiac output.  The "Guyton Curves" 
describe the relationship between right atrial pressures and cardiac output, and they form a foundation for understanding 
the physiology of circulation. 


The Guyton model of fluid, electrolyte, and circulatory regulation is an extensive mathematical model of human circulatory 
physiology, capable of simulating a variety of experimental conditions, and contains a number of linked subsystems relating 
to circulation and its neuroendocrine control.


This is a CellML translation of the Guyton model of the regulation of the circulatory system.  The complete model consists 
of separate modules each of which characterise a separate physiological subsystems.  The Circulation Dynamics is the primary 
system, to which other modules/blocks are connected.  The other modules characterise the dynamics of the kidney, electrolytes 
and cell water, thirst and drinking, hormone regulation, autonomic regulation, cardiovascular system etc, and these feedback 
on the central circulation model.  The CellML code in these modules is based on the C code from the programme C-MODSIM created 
by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.


This particular CellML model describes the effect of heart hypertrophy or heart deterioration on heart pumping capability.


There are several publications referring to the Guyton model. One of these papers is cited below:
