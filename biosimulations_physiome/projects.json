The Lipid Metabolites\n  and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid\n  metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on\n  various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a\n  lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids\n  known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have\n  reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and\n  signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have\n  developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate\n  the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined\n  using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model\n  fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme\n  activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative\n  model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can be used to\n  design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological\n  perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.\n\n\n  The original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n  An integrated model of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on\n  lipidomics flux analysis, Gupta S, Maurya MR, Stephens DL, Dennis EA,\n  Subramaniam S, 2009, Biophysical Journal, volume 96, 4542-4551.\n  PubMed ID:\n  19486676\n",

Although these are potentially significant in understanding diseases that are currently of unknown etiology, no suitable computational cell model exists to evaluate the effects of such mutations. Therefore, a biophysically based single cell model of human jejunal smooth muscle electrophysiology was developed. The resulting cellular description is able to reproduce experimentally recorded slow wave activity and produces realistic responses to a number of perturbations, providing a solid platform on which the causes of intestinal myopathies can be investigated.\n    \n\n      The original publication reference is cited below:\n    \n\n      A Quantitative Model of Human Jejunal Smooth Muscle Cell Electrophysiology, Yong Cheng Poh, Alberto Corrias, Nicholas Cheng, Martin Lindsay Buist, 2012, \n            PLoS ONE, 7(8): e42385.

We analysed the effect these cellular mechanisms have on whole heart function by making a computational model of mouse heart cells, and embedding this cellular model into a representation of the heart.  Unlike previous murine models, this model represents the heart at both body temperature and the high heart rates seen in these animals, allowing us to directly compare results from our computational model with experimental measurements.  Results show that effects from the rate of stretch are especially important for explaining the large differences observed between force generated by isolated cells and pressure measured experimentally.  The model also provides an important framework for future research focused on interpreting results from genetic manipulation experiments in mice.\n    \n\n      The original publication reference is cited below:\n    \n\n      An analysis of deformation-dependent electromechanical coupling in the mouse heart.

We sought to develop an in silico AP (isAP) model that provides an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte AP duration (APD) using concentration-effect curve data from a panel of five ICs (hNav1.5, hCav1.2, hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2, hKv7.1/hminK, hKv11.1). A test set of 53 compounds was selected to cover a range of selective and mixed IC modulators that were tested for their effects on optically measured APD. A threshold of >10% change in APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) was used to signify an effect at the top test concentration. To capture the variations observed in left ventricular midmyocardial myocyte APD data from 19 different dogs, the isAP model was calibrated to produce an ensemble of 19 model variants that could capture the shape and form of the APs and also quantitatively replicate dofetilide- and diltiazem-induced APD90 changes. Provided with IC panel data only, the isAP model was then used, blinded, to predict APD90 changes greater than 10%. At a simulated concentration of 30 \u00b5M and based on a criterion that six of the variants had to agree, isAP prediction was scored as showing greater than 80% predictivity of compound activity. Thus, early in drug discovery, the isAP model allows integrating separate IC data and is amenable to the throughput required for use as a virtual screen.\n    \n\n            Schematic diagram of the Davies et al. 2012 (Hund and Rudy 2004) Canine Ventricular Cell Model.\n          \n\n            The original paper reference is cited below:\n          \n\n            An in silico canine cardiac midmyocardial action potential duration model as a tool for early drug safety assessment, M.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR to reproduce published results. Some traces need to be matched to the SVG diagram.\nModel Structure\n\nInositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) is responsible for Ca2+ mobilization in response to external stimulation in many cell types. The latter phenomenon often occurs as repetitive Ca2+ spikes. In this study, the effect of the two Ins-1,4,5-P3 metabolizing enzymes (Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase) on the temporal pattern of Ca2+ oscillations has been investigated. On the basis of the well-documented Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase stimulation by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex and of the experimentally-determined kinetic characteristics of these enzymes, we predict that 5-phosphatase primarily controls the levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and, thereby, the occurrence and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Consequently, the model reproduces the experimental observation performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that 5-phosphatase overexpression has a much more pronounced effect on the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations than 3-kinase overexpression. We also investigated, in more detail, under which conditions a similar effect could be observed in other cell types expressing various Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase activities.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n'Simulations of the effects of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase activities on Ca2+ oscillations.', G Dupont, C Erneux, 1997 Cell Calcium, 22(5), 321-331.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR, and reproduces Figure 4 from the original paper. The results match output from a reference (IgorPro) implementation of the model provided by David Friel.\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: [Ca2+]i oscillations have been described in a variety of cells. This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Inactivation of the intracellular Ca2+ permeability, cooperative nonlinear Ca2+ uptake and extrusion mechanisms, and functional links between plasma membrane Ca2+ transport and the internal store are not required.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n[Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons: an experimental test of a theoretical model, David D.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model will run in OpenCell and COR to reproduce published results. The a model is based on equations 1-3 and works to reproduce published results. The b model is based on equations 1 and 4-8 and oscillates but does not reproduce results.\nModel Structure\n\nCytosolic calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in cellular signalling. Various cell types, including hepatocytes, display Ca2+ oscillations when stimulated by an extracellular signal. However, the biological relevance of this temporal organization remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the effect of Ca2+ oscillations on a particular example of cell regulation: the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle controlling the activation of glycogen phosphorylase in hepatocytes. By modelling periodic sinusoidal variations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, we show that Ca2+ oscillations reduce the threshold for the activation of the enzyme. Furthermore, as the activation of a given enzyme depends on the kinetics of its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, speciality can be encoded by the oscillation frequency. Finally, using a model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, we show that realistic Ca2+ oscillations can potentiate the response to a hormonal stimulation. These results indicate that Ca2+ oscillations in hepatocytes could contribute to increase the efficiency and speciality of cellular signalling, as shown experimentally for gene expression in lymphocytes (Dolmetsch et al., 1998).\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n",

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model has had a stimulus protocol added to it to allow simulation of action potentials. Unfortunately, the details of the stimulation defined in the original paper are not known and as such, the parameters of the stimulus (magnitude, duration, dimensions,) may not be appropriate. Currently, however, the model runs in PCEnv and is able to simulate a train of action potentials. COR will not currently run this model.\n          \n\nValidateCellML detects unit inconsistencies within this model.\n\nModel Structure\n\nIn this 1970 publication, Adrian, Chandler and Hodgkin developed a mathematical model of an action potential in frog striated muscle.  Their model was based on data from voltage-clamp experiments, and they include descriptions of three currents:\n\n\nINa\n, a fast inward sodium current;\n\nIK\n, a slow outward potassium current; and\n\nIL\n, a leak current.\n\nThe style of the model equations is based on the The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952.  However, the authors acknowledge that the situation in striated muscle is complicated by tubular resistance and capacity.  The transverse tubular system which exists in striated myocytes is represented in the model by a linear resistance and capacity in series.   \n\n\nAs the paper was published in 1970, there is no online version.

The R-point occurs in mid-to-late G1 phase and marks the transition between mitogendependent to mitogen-independent progression of the cell cycle. For purposes of computer simulations, the R-point is defined as the first point in time after mitosis where cutting off mitogen stimulation does not prevent the cell reaching the threshold activity of cyclin-E/cdk2 required for entry into S phase. The key components of the network that generate a dynamic switching behaviour associated with the R-point include a positive feedback loop between cyclin-E/cdk2 and Cdc25A, along with the mutually negative interaction between the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and cyclin-E/cdk2. Simulations of the passage through the R-point were carried out and the factors affecting the position of the R-point in G1 are determined. The detailed model also shows various points in the network where the activation of cyclin-E/cdk2 can be initiated with or without the involvement of the retinoblastoma protein.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\nThe kinetic origins of the restriction point in the mammalian cell cycle, B.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model runs in both OpenCell and COR. The units have been checked and they are consistent. The CellML model \"may\" replicate the published results - there are no simple results figures plotting substrate concentration against time in the paper. Neither are there any simple figures showing the results of the \"standard\" model (certain variables are altered in order to generate the figures as described in the figure captions). The model appears to be very sensitive to the initial conditions (concentrations) of the substrates in the pathway. Where these values have not been specified in the paper they have been set to 0.01.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: In order to investigate the influence of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics on cellular biochemistry, a mathematical model was formulated based on our own experimental evidence. The model couples microtubular protein (MTP) dynamics to the glycolytic pathway and its branches: the Krebs cycle, ethanolic fermentation, and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Results show that the flux through glycolysis coherently and coordinately increases or decreases with increased or decreased levels of polymerized MTP, respectively. The rates of individual enzymatic steps and metabolite concentrations change with the polymeric status of MTP throughout the metabolic network. Negative control is exerted by the PP pathway on the glycolytic flux, and the extent of inhibition depends inversely on the polymerization state of MTP, i.e. a high degree of polymerization relieves the negative control. The stability of the model's steady state dynamics for a wide range of variation of metabolic parameters increased with the degree of polymerized MTP. The findings indicate that the organization of the cytoskeleton bestows coherence and robustness to the coordination of cellular metabolism.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCoherent and robust modulation of a metabolic network by cytoskeletal organization and dynamics, Miguel A.

However, the relationships between tissue structure, wave conduction velocity and safety at such junctions are unknown. We develop a structurally and electrophysiologically detailed model of the canine Purkinje-ventricular junction (PVJ) and vary its heterogeneity parameters in order to determine such relationships. We show that neither very fast nor very slow conduction is safe, and there exists an optimal velocity providing the maximum safety factor of conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and morphological differences between the Purkinje fibre and ventricular tissue. The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite the adjacent ventricular tissue, but is not long enough for the source-to-load mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time. The observed relationships between the conduction velocity and safety factor can provide new insights into optimal conditions for wave propagation through non-uniform junctions between various cardiac tissues.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nOptimal velocity and safety of discontinuous conduction through the heterogeneous Purkinje-ventricular junction, Oleg V.

We would like to thank the original model author Oleg Aslanidi for his help in the final stages of model curation.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Experimental evidence suggests that regional differences in action potential (AP) morphology can provide a substrate for initiation and maintenance of reentrant arrhythmias in the right atrium (RA), but the relationships between the complex electrophysiological and anatomical organization of the RA and the genesis of reentry are unclear. In this study, a biophysically detailed three-dimensional computer model of the right atrial tissue was constructed to study the role of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy in arrhythmogenesis. The model of Lindblad et al. for a rabbit atrial cell was modified to incorporate experimental data on regional differences in several ionic currents (primarily, I(Na), I(CaL), I(K1), I(to), and I(sus)) between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscle cells. The modified model was validated by its ability to reproduce the AP properties measured experimentally. The anatomical model of the rabbit RA (including tissue geometry and fiber orientation) was based on a recent histological reconstruction. Simulations with the resultant electrophysiologically and anatomically detailed three-dimensional model show that complex organization of the RA tissue causes breakdown of regular AP conduction patterns at high pacing rates (>11.75 Hz): as the AP in the crista terminalis cells is longer, and electrotonic coupling transverse to fibers of the crista terminalis is weak, high-frequency pacing at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles results in a unidirectional conduction block toward the crista terminalis and generation of reentry. Contributions of the tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy to reentry initiation mechanisms are quantified by measuring action potential duration (APD) gradients at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles: the APD gradients are high in areas where both heterogeneity and anisotropy are high, such that intrinsic APD differences are not diminished by electrotonic interactions. Thus, our detailed computer model reconstructs complex electrical activity in the RA, and provides new insights into the mechanisms of transition from focal atrial tachycardia into reentry.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMechanisms of transition from normal to reentrant electrical activity in a model of rabbit atrial tissue: interaction of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy, Oleg V.

The units have been checked and are consistent.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Despite the establishment of the important role of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis, a molecular-level understanding of the origin of its dichotomous pro- and anti-apoptotic effects has been elusive. We propose a new mathematical model for simulating the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis. The new model integrates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways with NO-related reactions, to gain insights into the regulatory effect of the reactive NO species N(2)O(3), non-heme iron nitrosyl species (FeL(n)NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). The biochemical pathways of apoptosis coupled with NO-related reactions are described by ordinary differential equations using mass-action kinetics. In the absence of NO, the model predicts either cell survival or apoptosis (a bistable behavior) with shifts in the onset time of apoptotic response depending on the strength of extracellular stimuli. Computations demonstrate that the relative concentrations of anti- and pro-apoptotic reactive NO species, and their interplay with glutathione, determine the net anti- or pro-apoptotic effects at long time points. Interestingly, transient effects on apoptosis are also observed in these simulations, the duration of which may reach up to hours, despite the eventual convergence to an anti-apoptotic state. Our computations point to the importance of precise timing of NO production and external stimulation in determining the eventual pro- or anti-apoptotic role of NO.\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n  Computational Insights on the Competing Effects of Nitric Oxide in Regulating Apoptosis.

We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-a-vis apoptosome formation.\n  \nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n  Bistability in Apoptosis: Roles of Bax, Bcl-2 and Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pores.

We propose a new mathematical model for simulating the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis. The new model integrates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways with NO-related reactions, to gain insights into the regulatory effect of the reactive NO species N(2)O(3), non-heme iron nitrosyl species (FeL(n)NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). The biochemical pathways of apoptosis coupled with NO-related reactions are described by ordinary differential equations using mass-action kinetics. In the absence of NO, the model predicts either cell survival or apoptosis (a bistable behavior) with shifts in the onset time of apoptotic response depending on the strength of extracellular stimuli. Computations demonstrate that the relative concentrations of anti- and pro-apoptotic reactive NO species, and their interplay with glutathione, determine the net anti- or pro-apoptotic effects at long time points.

At present it is impossible to remove the glycosome without changing much of the rest of the cell. It would seem impossible, therefore, to assess the metabolic consequences of this compartmentation. Therefore, we here develop a computer experimentation approach, which we call computational cell biology. A validated molecular kinetic computer replica was built of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Removing the glycosome membrane in that replica had little effect on the steady-state flux, which argues against the prevalent speculation that glycosomes serve to increase flux by concentrating the enzymes. Removal of the membrane did cause (i) the sugar phosphates to rise to unphysiologically high levels, which must have pathological effects, and (ii) a failure to recover from glucose deprivation. We explain these effects on the basis of the biochemical organization of the glycosome. We conclude (i) that the glycosome protects trypanosomes from the negative side effects of the \"turbo\" structure of glycolysis and (ii) that computer experimentation based on solid molecular data is a powerful tool to address questions that are not, or not yet, accessible to experimentation.   \n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\nCompartmentation protects trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis, Barbara M.

Most glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei have been purified and characterized kinetically. In this paper a mathematical model of glycolysis in the bloodstream form of this organism is developed on the basis of all available kinetic data. The fluxes and the cytosolic metabolite concentrations as predicted by the model were in accordance with available data as measured in non-growing trypanosomes, both under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions. The model also reproduced the inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis by glycerol, although the amount of glycerol needed to inhibit glycolysis completely was lower than experimentally determined. At low extracellular glucose concentrations the intracellular glucose concentration remained very low, and only at 5 mM of extracellular glucose, free glucose started to accumulate intracellularly, in close agreement with experimental observations. This biphasic relation could be related to the large difference between the affinities of the glucose transporter and hexokinase for intracellular glucose. The calculated intraglycosomal metabolite concentrations demonstrated that enzymes that have been shown to be near-equilibrium in the cytosol must work far from equilibrium in the glycosome in order to maintain the high glycolytic flux in the latter.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nGlycolysis in Bloodstream Form Trypanosoma brucei Can Be Understood in Terms of the Kinetics of the Glycolytic Enzyme, Barbara M.

There are no simple figures of concentration against time in the publication to compare the CellML model simulation output against.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Calcium sparks in frog intact skeletal muscle fibers were modeled as stereotypical events that arise from a constant efflux of Ca(2+) from a point source for a fixed period of time (e.g., 2.5 pA of Ca(2+) current for 4.6 ms; 18 degrees C). The model calculates the local changes in the concentrations of free Ca(2+) and of Ca(2+) bound to the major intrinsic myoplasmic Ca(2+) buffers (troponin, ATP, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca(2+) pump) and to the Ca(2+) indicator (fluo-3). A distinctive feature of the model is the inclusion of a binding reaction between fluo-3 and myoplasmic proteins, a process that strongly affects fluo-3's Ca(2+)-reaction kinetics, its apparent diffusion constant, and hence the morphology of sparks. DeltaF/F (the change in fluo-3's fluorescence divided by its resting fluorescence) was estimated from the calculated changes in fluo-3 convolved with the microscope point-spread function. To facilitate comparisons with measured sparks, noise and other sources of variability were included in a random repetitive fashion to generate a large number of simulated sparks that could be analyzed in the same way as the measured sparks. In the initial simulations, the binding of Ca(2+) to the two regulatory sites on troponin was assumed to follow identical and independent binding reactions. These simulations failed to accurately predict the falling phase of the measured sparks. A second set of simulations, which incorporated the idea of positive cooperativity in the binding of Ca(2+) to troponin, produced reasonable agreement with the measurements. Under the assumption that the single channel Ca(2+) current of a ryanodine receptor (RYR) is 0.5-2 pA, the results suggest that 1-5 active RYRs generate an average Ca(2+) spark in a frog intact muscle fiber. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComparison of simulated and measured calcium sparks in intact skeletal muscle fibers of the frog, S.M.

The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F1F0 ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate\\u2013hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K+/H+ antiporter and passive H+ and K+ permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.    \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nA Biophysical Model of the Mitochondrial Respiratory System and Oxidative Phosphorylation, Daniel A.

Please note that this particular version of the CellML model does not correspond with any one of the four possible models from the original publication.

The models span from a single compartment, inflexible lung to a single compartment, flexible lung with pulmonary gas exchange. It is shown how the models are related to well-known models in the literature. A long-term purpose of this work is to study nonlinear phenomena seen in the cardio-respiratory system (for example, synchronization between ventilation rate and heart rate, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration). The models developed in this paper can be regarded as the controlled system (plant) and provide a mathematical framework to link between \"molecular-level\", and \"systems-level\" models. It is shown how changes in molecular level affect the alveolar partial pressure. Two assumptions that have previously been made are re-examined: (1) the hidden assumption that the air flow through the mouth is equal to the rate of volume change in the lungs, and, (2) the assumption that the process of oxygen binding to hemoglobin is near equilibrium. Conditions under which these assumptions are valid are studied. All the parameters in the models, except two, are physiologically realistic. Numerical results are consistent with published experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSimplified models for gas exchange in the human lungs, Alona Ben-Tal, 2006.\n\t Journal of Theoretical Biology, 238(2), 474-495.

        "description": "Model Status\n\nThis CellML model runs in both PCEnv and COR to recreate the published results.  The units have been checked and they are balanced.  Please note that this particular version of the CellML model does not correspond with any one of the four possible models from the original publication.  Rather it is a combination model, made up of equations 2,7,9,10,11,12,13,16, and 20.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: This paper presents a hierarchy of models with increasing complexity for gas exchange in the human lungs. The models span from a single compartment, inflexible lung to a single compartment, flexible lung with pulmonary gas exchange. It is shown how the models are related to well-known models in the literature. A long-term purpose of this work is to study nonlinear phenomena seen in the cardio-respiratory system (for example, synchronization between ventilation rate and heart rate, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration). The models developed in this paper can be regarded as the controlled system (plant) and provide a mathematical framework to link between \"molecular-level\", and \"systems-level\" models. It is shown how changes in molecular level affect the alveolar partial pressure. Two assumptions that have previously been made are re-examined: (1) the hidden assumption that the air flow through the mouth is equal to the rate of volume change in the lungs, and, (2) the assumption that the process of oxygen binding to hemoglobin is near equilibrium. Conditions under which these assumptions are valid are studied. All the parameters in the models, except two, are physiologically realistic. Numerical results are consistent with published experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSimplified models for gas exchange in the human lungs, Alona Ben-Tal, 2006.\n\t Journal of Theoretical Biology, 238(2), 474-495.

The first model of cardiac tissue was developed by Noble in 1962 (see Noble Purkinje Fibre Model, 1962), and contained only four variables.  During the following years, improvements in both experimental and computational methods lead to the development of successively more accurate models, for example the Luo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994, and the Noble Ventricular Cell Model, 1998.  Recently, comprehensive models have been published which are cell type specific, for example: Nygren et al., 1998; and Courtemanche et al., 1998 have developed models of atrial cells, while others have produced models of the sinoatrial node: Demir et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000; and Boyett et al., 2001, or ventricular myocytes: Puglisi-Bers, 2001 and Pandit et al., 2001.   \n\n\nIn 1998, Priebe and Beuckelmann published a model of a single human ventricular cell.  This was based mainly on the Luo-Rudy II model for a guinea-pig ventricular myocyte, however, five currents (IKr\n, IKs\n, ICa\n, Ito\n and IK1\n) were based on experimental data obtained from human myocytes.  The remaining currents from the original LR model were scaled to fit human cell data.  Priebe and Beuckelmann used their model to compare the electrophysiological properties of healthy and failing ventricular myocytes.  The model was accurate, but its complexity and large number of variables make it computationally inefficient.  In addition, as a , made up of ordinary differential equations describing the time dependence of membrane potential, gating variables and ion concentrations, the PB model was unstable.     \n\n\nOften it is not necessary to model the ionic currents of a cell with the accuracy and complexity inherent in the biophysically based models. With a view to investigating phenomena on a larger spatial and temporal scale, several ionic current models have been developed that do not seek to model subcellular processes but only to provide an action potential at a minimal computational cost.  Such models include The FitzHugh-Nagumo Model, 1961.  However, this approach does not reproduce the shape of action potential, which is important in electrocardiography studies.  Neither does it allow the analysis of the effects of individual ionic currents on cardiac activation.\n\n\nIn 2002, Bernus et al. published a mathematical model of human ventricular cells, which was somewhere in between the complex PB and the simple FN models.  Their new model was simpler, 4.9 times faster, and more stable than the original PB model on which it was based, yet it was sufficiently complex to retain the shape of the action potential at various frequencies, and also the restitution properties of the human ventricular tissue.  This was achieved by reducing the original PB model to a six-variable model (see \n    the figure\n   below).  Major ionic currents were retained, but some single cell properties that do not have a large influence on the properties of the tissue were discarded.  Model simulations were able to reproduce the properties of epicardial, endocardial and M cells by modifying selected ionic currents (this raw CellML model is specific to the epicardial cells).  In addition, at the tissue level, Bernus et al. were able to simulate spiral wave behaviour in a 2-D sheet of human ventricular tissue.  Simulation results were supported by their agreement with experimental data.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computationally efficient electrophysiological model of human ventricular cells, O.

The units have been checked and there are no inconsistencies (just equivalences).\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT:  Computational modeling is used to investigate the functional impact of G protein-mediated presynaptic autoinhibition on synaptic filtering properties. It is demonstrated that this form of autoinhibition, which is relieved by depolarization, acts as a high-pass filter. This contrasts with vesicle depletion, which acts as a low-pass filter. Model parameters are adjusted to reproduce kinetic slowing data from different Gbetagamma dimeric isoforms, which produce different degrees of slowing. With these sets of parameter values, we demonstrate that the range of frequencies filtered out by the autoinhibition varies greatly depending on the Gbetagamma isoform activated by the autoreceptors. It is shown that G protein autoinhibition can enhance the spatial contrast between a spatially distributed high-frequency signal and surrounding low-frequency noise, providing an alternate mechanism to lateral inhibition. It is also shown that autoinhibition can increase the fidelity of coincidence detection by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the postsynaptic cell. The filter cut, the input frequency below which signals are filtered, depends on several biophysical parameters in addition to those related to Gbetagamma binding and unbinding. By varying one such parameter, the rate at which transmitter unbinds from autoreceptors, we show that the filter cut can be adjusted up or down for several of the Gbetagamma isoforms. This allows for great synapse-to-synapse variability in the distinction between signal and noise.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRole for G Protein G-Beta-Gamma Isoform Specificity in Synaptic Signal Processing: A Computational Study, Richard Bertram, Michelle I.

We then use it to investigate the mitochondrialresponses to glycolytic and calcium input. WWe use the model to explain experimental observations of the opposite effects of raising cytosolic Ca(2+)in low and high glucose, and to predict the effects of a mutation in the mitochondrial enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) in pancreatic beta-cells.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nA simplified model for mitochondrial ATP production, Richard Bertram, Morten Gram Pedersenb, Dan S.

This version of the CellML model represents the fast bursting model where gs1=20.  The model replicates figure 2 in the published paper.  The model runs in both PCEnv and COR and the units are consistent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nThe phantom burster model for pancreatic beta-cells, Richard Bertram, Joseph Previte, Arthur Sherman, Tracie A.

We demonstrate the mechanism for episodic bursting using a minimal mathematical model for \"phantom bursting.\" Depending on the location in parameter space, this model can produce fast, medium, or slow bursting, or in the present case, fast, slow, and episodic bursting. The episodic bursting is modestly robust to noise and to parameter variation, and the effect that noise has on the episodic bursting pattern is quite different from that of an alternate episodic burst mechanism in which the slow envelope is produced by metabolic oscillations.

The model runs in PCEnv in COR and is able to produce the published results. The parameters have been chosen to recreate the bursting behaviour seen in figures 3 and 4 of the original paper. Some equations have inconsistent magnitudes due to the fact that some units are defined in milliseconds whereas others are defined in seconds.\nModel Structure\nGlucose metabolism plays a key signalling role in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells. In addition to generating ATP - the ubiquitous form of energy used to fuel many cellular processes - glucose metabolism in pancreatic beta cells is also the means by which blood glucose levels are monitored, ensuring an appropriate level of insulin secretion. ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the plasma membrane are activated by ADP and are inactivated by ATP, therefore a high ATP/ADP ratio results in a reduced number of open, ATP-sensitive, potassium channels. In turn, this results in membrane depolarisation and voltage-sensitive calcium channels open. The resulting influx of calcium ions into the cell cytosol induces insulin secretion, which in a healthy individual typically occurs in oscillatory waves. These can be fast with an oscillatory period of less than a minute, or slow with a duration of 2 to 7 minutes, or they can be a combination of fast and slow waves. This oscillatory pattern of insulin secretion appears to have a physiological function which is of particular interest since it is lost in patients with type II diabetes.\n\n                    Although the definitive mechanisms underlying these insulin oscillations are unknown, in the paper described here, Richard Bertram et al. suggest that calcium feedback onto ATP production or consumption is responsible for the fast component of the insulin oscillations, while oscillations in the glycolytic pathway are responsible for the slow component. Furthermore, they build these phenomena into a mathematical model that combines a model of mitochondrial metabolism with models of glycolytic oscillations, plasma membrane electrical activity, and calcium handling in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (summarised in the figure below).\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n                    Interaction of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in metabolic oscillations of pancreatic islets, Richard Bertram, Leslie S.

This file runs in PCEnv and COR and produces the expected output.  This model has been parameterised for the 'glycolytic bursting' model. Some equations have inconsistent magnitudes due to the fact that time is defined in milliseconds, yet flux is defined in micromolar per second.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Pancreatic islets of Langerhans produce bursts of electrical activity when exposed to stimulatory glucose levels. These bursts often have a regular repeating pattern, with a period of 10-60 s. In some cases, however, the bursts are episodic, clustered into bursts of bursts, which we call compound bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free Ca2+ concentration, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intraislet glucose levels that exhibit very slow oscillations, with faster oscillations superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the feedback of cytosolic Ca2+ onto ion channels that can account for bursting, and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations driven by oscillations in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the slow mode of compound bursting in the model. We also show that it is possible for glycolytic oscillations alone to drive a very slow form of bursting, which we call \"glycolytic bursting.\" Finally, the model predicts that there is bistability between stationary and oscillatory glycolysis for a range of parameter values. We provide experimental support for this model prediction. Overall, the model can account for a diversity of islet behaviors described in the literature over the past 20 years.\n\n\nCalcium and Glycolysis Mediate Multiple Bursting Modes in Pancreatic Islets, Richard Bertram, Leslie Satin, Min Zhang, Paul Smolen, and Arthur Sherman, 2004,\n            Biophysical Journal, 87, 3074-3087.

It is currently unsuitably constrained and can not be solved.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nPancreatic beta-cells are located in clusters within the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans.  Beta-cells secrete the hormone insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels, and in doing so, they play an essential role in glucose homeostasis.  When beta-cells fail to function properly, this can lead to pathologies such as type II diabetes.\n\n\nInsulin secretion is oscillatory, and it is in-phase with oscillations in the free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and theses Ca2+ oscillations reflect a bursting pattern in the beta-cell electrical activity.  Electrical bursting consists of periodic active phases of cell firing (excitation) followed by silent phases of hyperpolarisation (rest).  These oscillations can be divided into three categories:\n\n2+\n2+\n\nFast bursting, which has a period between 2 and 5 seconds and which often occurs in single cells and in islets where acetylcholine is present;\n\nMedium bursting, which has a period of 10 to 60 seconds and which occurs in islets where there is a stimulatory glucose concentration; and\n\nSlow bursting, which has a period of 2 to 4 minutes and which occurs in single cells and in islets.\n\nThe first mathematical models of beta-cells were developed to describe medium bursting, and the first models to address the variability in beta-cell oscillations were developed by Chay in 1995 and 1997 (see Extracellular and Intracellular Calcium Effects on Pancreatic Beta Cells, Chay, 1997 for more details).  In these models the main mechanism for oscillations was variation in the Ca2+ concentration in the ER, which directly or indirectly modulates one or more Ca2+-dependent channels.  In the Bertram and Sherman model described here the authors analyse in detail how the ER exerts its affects using a phantom bursting model (see \n    the figure\n   below). \n\n2+\n2+\n\nThe phantom bursting model is a general paradigm for temporal plasticity in bursting in beta-cells in which bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow variables with disparate time constants (see The Phantom Burster Model for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, 2000 for more details).  There are three potential slow variables which could drive the phantom bursting in vivo:\n\ncytosolic Ca2+ concentration;\n2+\nER Ca2+ concentration;\n2+\nand the ADP to ATP ratio.\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Calcium-based Phantom Bursting Model for Pancreatic Islets, Richard Bertram and Arthur Sherman, 2004, \nBulletin of Mathematical Biology\n, 66, 1313-1344.

Additional phenomena, such as the biphasic responses of beta-cells to changes in glucose concentration and the depolarizing effects of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump poison thapsigargin, are also accounted for by our model.

Modern simulation tools make the analysis of key components and their interactions very effective. This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene-protein network governing the G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. RESULTS: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator-inhibitor module can lead to bistability. Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability. We relate these bifurcations to the cell cycle checkpoint and the G1/S phase transition point. Thus, core modules can explain major features of the complex G1/S network and have a robust decision taking function.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n'Bifurcation analysis of the regulatory modules of \nthe mammalian G1/S transition', Maciej Swat, Alexander Kel,Hanspeter Herzel 2004 Bioinformatics, 10, 1506-1511.

Such oscillations are believed to underlie oscillatory intercellular calcium waves in some cell types, and thus it is important to understand how they occur and are modified by intercellular coupling. Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations. Coupling two nonidentical cells leads to more complex behaviors such as cascades of period doubling and multiply periodic solutions. This study is a first step towards understanding the role and significance of the diffusion of calcium through gap junctions in the coordination of oscillatory calcium waves in a variety of cell types.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA bifurcation analysis of two coupled calcium oscillators, Michael Bindschadler and James Sneyd, 2001, CHAOS, 11, 237-246.

Wherever possible, we used Markov models to represent the molecular structure and function of ion channels. The model includes detailed intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, with simulations of localized events such as sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release into a small intracellular volume bounded by the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transporter-mediated Ca2+ fluxes from the bulk cytosol are closely matched to the experimentally reported values and predict stimulation rate-dependent changes in Ca2+ transients. Our model reproduces the properties of cardiac myocytes from two different regions of the heart: the apex and the septum. The septum has a relatively prolonged AP, which reflects a relatively small contribution from the rapid transient outward K+ current in the septum. The attribution of putative molecular bases for several of the component currents enables our mouse model to be used to simulate the behavior of genetically modified transgenic mice.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n          Computer model of action potential of mouse ventricular myocytes, Vladimir E.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential risks and benefits of interrupted therapy using standard population dynamical models of HIV replication kinetics. METHODS: Standard population dynamical models were used to study the effect of structured therapy interruptions on the immune effector cells, the latent cell compartment and the emergence of drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The models suggest that structured therapy interruption only leads to transient or sustained virus control if the immune effector cells increase during therapy. This increase must more than counterbalance the increase in susceptible target cells induced by therapy. The risk of inducing drug resistance by therapy interruptions or the risk of repopulating the pool of latent cells during drug-free periods may be small if the virus population remains at levels considerably below baseline. However, if the virus load increases during drug-free periods to levels similar to or higher than baseline before therapy, both these risks increase dramatically.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRisks and benefits of structured antiretroviral drug therapy interruptions in HIV-1 infection, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Michal Rembiszewski, Gabriel M.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are commonly observed in a large number of cell types in response to stimulation by an extracellular agonist.  In most cell types the mechanism of regular spiking is well understood and models based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) can account for many experimental observations.  However, cells do not always exhibit simple Ca2+ oscillations.  In response to given agonists, some cells show more complex behaviour in the form of bursting, i.e. trains of Ca2+ spikes separated by silent phases.  Here we develop several theoretical models, based on physiologically plausible assumptions, that could account for complex intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.  The models are all based on one- or two-pool models based on CICR.  We extend these models by (i) considering the inhibition of the Ca2+-release channel on a unique intracellular store at high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, (ii) taking into account the Ca2+-activated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), or (iii) considering explicitly the evolution of the Ca2+ concentration in two different pools, one sensitive and the other one insensitive to IP3.  Besides simple periodic oscillations, these three models can all account for more complex oscillatory behaviour in the form of bursting.  Moreover, the model that takes the kinetics of IP3 into account shows chaotic behaviour.\nComplex intracellular calcium oscillations.  A theoretical exploration of possible mechanisms, Jose A.M.

We term these modules GTPase-cycle modules. The local concentrations of these proteins are spatially regulated between plasma membrane microdomains and between the plasma membrane and cytosol, but no data or models are available that quantitatively explain the effect of such regulation on signaling. We present a computational model of the GTPase-cycle module that predicts that the interplay of local G protein, R, and GAP concentrations gives rise to 16 distinct signaling regimes and numerous intermediate signaling phenomena. The regimes suggest alternative modes of the GTPase-cycle module that occur based on defined local concentrations of the component proteins. In one mode, signaling occurs while G protein and receptor are unclustered and GAP eliminates signaling; in another, G protein and receptor are clustered and GAP can rapidly modulate signaling but does not eliminate it. Experimental data from multiple GTPase-cycle modules is interpreted in light of these predictions. The latter mode explains previously paradoxical data in which GAP does not alter maximal current amplitude of G protein-activated ion channels, but hastens signaling. The predictions indicate how variations in local concentrations of the component proteins create GTPase-cycle modules with distinctive phenotypes. They provide a quantitative framework for investigating how regulation of local concentrations of components of the GTPase-cycle module affects signaling.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComputational modeling reveals how interplay between components of a GTPase-cycle module regulates signal transduction, Scott J.

However the model will not run in either OpenCell or COR and the model requires further curation.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The possible effects of intracellular Ca2+ on the pacemaker of the heart, the sinoatrial node, are reviewed. In mammalian sinoatrial node, reduction or abolition of the intracellular Ca2+ transient by ryanodine, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump block or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) reduces the spontaneous rate by 21-32%, whereas in amphibian sinus venosus it abolishes spontaneous activity. In rabbit sinoatrial node, ryanodine/BAPTA reduces the T-type Ca2+ current (iCa,T), perhaps slows inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current (iCa,L), reduces the inward Na+-Ca2+ exchange current (iNaCa), and reduces the rapid and slow delayed rectifier K+ currents (iK,r and iK,s, respectively). Other evidence shows that a reduction of intracellular Ca2+ inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated current (if). These putative intracellular Ca2+-dependent changes in ionic currents have been incorporated into different models of rabbit sinoatrial node action potentials. In the models, block of the Ca2+ transient reduced the spontaneous rate by 24 and 26% in the central and peripheral models of Zhang and others, 13% in the Oxsoft model (Noble et al.), 9% in the model of Wilders and others, and 41% in the model of Demir and others. In all models, the reduction in rate was not primarily the result of the decrease in iNaCa, but instead the combination of all changes in ionic currents.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nControl of the pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node by intracellular Ca2+.

The model also runs in COR but due to the time being in minutes and the simulation time being 3000 minutes long the model is not ideal for running in COR.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Studies in animals and humans suggest that the diurnal pattern in plasma melatonin levels is due to the hormone's rates of synthesis, circulatory infusion and clearance, circadian control of synthesis onset and offset, environmental lighting conditions, and error in the melatonin immunoassay. A two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min, synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good agreement with values from previous reports. The difference between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min). The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably estimated from a single model.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of diurnal variations in human plasma melatonin levels, Emery N.

Details about the project can be found here:\u00a0http://2008.igem.org/Team:Newcastle_University.\n\nA constitutive promoter leads to the production of proteins spaK and spaR. Subtilin activates spaK which in turn activates spaR. Activated spaR is a transcriptional regulator for GFP.

Please note that the model has to be run for a duration of 10000 ms with a step size of 0.01 ms and a high point density of 100000 points/graph.  This model represents model 1 from the published paper (which does not include a slow potassium current).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current INaP-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current INaP and slow activation of a K+ current IKS. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-BotC oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to >1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModels of Respiratory Rhythm Generation in the Pre-Botzinger Complex.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        This CellML model represents a neuronal network with 5 cells.  The model runs in OpenCell (but not in COR as it is a CellML 1.1 model). The units have been checked and they are consistent.  It's unlikely that the CellML model perfectly replicates the results of the published model as in the paper, the values of g_syn_e were randomly selected from a normal distribution.  Because random sampling can't yet be described in CellML the values of g_syn_e have all been set to 0.1nS in the current model.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We have proposed models for the ionic basis of oscillatory bursting of respiratory pacemaker neurons in the Pre-Botzinger complex. In this paper, we investigate the frequency control and synchronization of these model neurons when coupled by excitatory amino-acid-mediated synapses and controlled by convergent synaptic inputs modeled as tonic excitation. Simulations of pairs of identical cells reveal that increasing tonic excitation increases the frequency of synchronous bursting, while increasing the strength of excitatory coupling between the neurons decreases the frequency of synchronous bursting. Low levels of coupling extend the range of values of tonic excitation where synchronous bursting is found. Simulations of a heterogeneous population of 50-500 bursting neurons reveal coupling effects similar to those found experimentally in vitro: coupling increases the mean burst duration and decreases the mean burst frequency. Burst synchronization occurred over a wide range of intrinsic frequencies (0.1-1 Hz) and even in populations where as few as 10% of the cells were intrinsically bursting. Weak coupling, extreme parameter heterogeneity, and low levels of depolarizing input could contribute to the desynchronization of the population and give rise to quasiperiodic states. The introduction of sparse coupling did not affect the burst synchrony, although it did make the interburst intervals more irregular from cycle to cycle. At a population level, both parameter heterogeneity and excitatory coupling synergistically combine to increase the dynamic input range: robust synchronous bursting persisted across a much greater range of parameter space (in terms of mean depolarizing input) than that of a single model cell. This extended dynamic range for the bursting cell population indicates that cellular heterogeneity is functionally advantageous. Our modeled system accounts for the range of intrinsic frequencies and spiking patterns of inspiratory (I) bursting cells found in the Pre-Botzinger complex in neonatal rat brain stem slices in vitro. There is a temporal dispersion in the spiking onset times of neurons in the population, predicted to be due to heterogeneity in intrinsic neuronal properties, with neurons starting to spike before (pre-I), with (I), or after (late-I) the onset of the population burst. Experimental tests for a number of the model's predictions are proposed.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModels of respiratory rhythm generation in the Pre-Botzinger complex.

During these mitotic cycles, there are barely detectable oscillations in the total level of B-type cyclins. In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations. The model can be used to predict the phenotypes of novel mutations and effective ranges of the unmeasured rate constants and transport coefficients in the proposed mechanism.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDynamical modeling of syncytial mitotic cycles in Drosophila embryos, Laurence Calzone, Denis Thieffry, John J Tyson, Bela Novak, 2007, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMolecular Systems Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t, 3, 131.

This autonomous regulation is most dramatic in asynchronous insect flight muscle and gives rise to wing beat frequencies that exceed the frequency capacity of neural motor control systems. Stretch activation in insect flight muscle allows the contractile features of the flight muscle to be matched and tuned to the wing-thorax-aerodynamic load to ensure proper muscle contraction frequency and effort for flight (Pringle, 1977); a role for which intrinsic autonomous regulation is especially suited. In stretch-sensitive insect flight muscles, neurally controlled intracellular calcium plays a permissive role (it needs to be present at adequate levels to allow the intrinsic stretch activation mechanisms to operate) but it is not the dominant player in force generation or in work production. That role belongs to stretch itself, which activates the myofilament system in such a way (i.e., with appropriate phase delay) to generate force and perform rhythmic work. \n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFunction of Stretch Activation in Heart Muscle, Kenneth B.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model runs in OpenCell and can reproduce one oscillation (which is true to the published results) but is unable to produce further oscillations. This is probably because there are time delays in the origianl model which as yet can not be described in CellML.  The units have been checked and they are consistent with just small equivalencies in pico and nano grams per ml. The CellML model also runs in COR but the long duration of the simulation is not ideal for this tool.\n          \n\nValidateCellML verifies this model as valid CellML, although unit inconsistencies are detected.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We produce here a model to explain the control of testosterone secretion. In this model the hypothalamic secretion of the hormone LHRH (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone) is controlled by a combination of local testosterone concentration and of the local concentration of the pituitary hormone LH (luteinizing hormone). Since LHRH stimulates the release of LH, and LH in turn stimulates the release of testosterone, the three hormones constitute a three-component \"feedback\" network. We show how this model is able to account for the pulsatility of the release of these three hormones. Furthermore, the model is consistent with results obtained from a wide range of experimental manipulations of the system. For example, it accounts for the changes observed in hormone release patterns after castration. In particular, it follows that no \"neural clock\", or \"neural pulse-generator\", is required to force the system into pulsatile behaviour.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model for the control of testosterone secretion, Mark Cartwright and Masud Husain, 1986, \n            Journal of Theoretical Biology\n           123, 239-250.

We are unsure whether or not the model recreates the published results as there are no simple figures of changing concentration against time.  Also sodium and chloride are set to constant values in this model - we suspect we need to derive an ODE equation based on the reaction figure (fig 1) in the paper.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to construct a numerical model of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC) that can predict kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport of TSC. We hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying these kinetic properties can be approximated by a state diagram in which the transporter has two binding sites, one for sodium and another for chloride and thiazide. On the basis of the state diagram, a system of linear equations that should be satisfied in the steady state was postulated. Numerical solution of these equations yielded model prediction of kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport. Rate constants, which determine transitional rates between states, were systematically adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantitatively estimate the difference between model predictions and experimental results. With the resultant rate constants, the model could simulate the following experimental results: 1) dissociation constant of thiazide in the absence of sodium and chloride; 2) inhibitory effect of chloride on thiazide binding; 3) stimulatory effect of sodium on thiazide binding; 4) combined effects of sodium and chloride on thiazide binding; 5) dependence of sodium influx on extracellular sodium and chloride; and 6) inhibition of sodium influx by extracellular thiazide. We conclude that known kinetic properties of TSC can be predicted by a model which is based on a state diagram.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA kinetic model of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter, Hangil Chang and Toshiro Fujita, 1999,\n            American Journal of Physiology, 276, F952-F959.

It should be noted that the initial conditions used in this description represent those in the early distal tubule. For model representations of the late distal tublule, these initial values should be replaced with those listed in the orginal paper for the late distal tubule. The model from the original paper has been modified slightly to include differential equations defining the change in solute concentrations over time. These equations were added to facilitate the use of the CellML code in CMISS. Note that the model is not running correctly in COR or OpenCell and there are unit inconsistencies.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A numerical model of the rat distal tubule was developed to simulate water and solute transport in this nephron segment. This model incorporates the following: 1) Na-Cl cotransporter, K-Cl cotransporter, Na channel, K channel, and Cl channel in the luminal membrane; 2) Na-K-ATPase, K channel, and Cl channel in the basolateral membrane; and 3) conductances for Na, K, and Cl in the paracellular pathway. Transport rates were calculated using kinetic equations. Axial heterogeneity was represented by partitioning the model into two subsegments with different sets of model parameters. Model equations derived from the principles of mass conservation and electrical neutrality were solved numerically. Values of the model parameters were adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantify the difference between model predictions and experimental results. The developed model could simulate the water and solute transport of the distal tubule in the normal state, as well as in conditions including thiazide or amiloride application and various levels of sodium load and tubular flow rate.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA numerical model of the renal distal tubule, Hangil Chang and Toshiro Fujita, 1999,\n            American Journal of Physiology, 276, F952-F959.

We have previously reported a model that deals with transport of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), and water in this nephron segment (Chang H and Fujita T. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 276: F931-F951, 1999). In this study, we extend our previous model by incorporating buffer systems, new cell types, and new transport mechanisms. Specifically, the model incorporates bicarbonate, ammonium, and phosphate buffer systems; has cell types corresponding to intercalated cells; and includes the Na/H exchanger, H-ATPase, and anion exchanger. Incorporation of buffer systems has required the following modifications of model equations: new model equations are introduced to represent chemical equilibria of buffer partners [e.g., pH = pK(a) + log(10) (NH(3)/NH(4))], and the formulation of mass conservation is extended to take into account interconversion of buffer partners. Furthermore, finite rates of H(2)CO(3)-CO(2) interconversion are taken into account in modeling the bicarbonate buffer system. Owing to this treatment, the model can simulate the development of disequilibrium pH in the distal tubular fluid. For each new transporter, a state diagram has been constructed to simulate its transport kinetics. With appropriate assignment of maximal transport rates for individual transporters, the model predictions are in agreement with free-flow micropuncture experiments in terms of HCO reabsorption rate in the normal state as well as under the high bicarbonate load. Although the model cannot simulate all of the microperfusion experiments, especially those that showed a flow-dependent increase in HCO reabsorption, the model is consistent with those microperfusion experiments that showed HCO reabsorption rates similar to those in the free-flow micropuncture experiments. We conclude that it is possible to develop a numerical model of the rat distal tubule that simulates acid-base transport, as well as basic solute and water transport, on the basis of tubular geometry, physical principles, and transporter kinetics. Such a model would provide a useful means of integrating detailed kinetic properties of transporters and predicting macroscopic transport characteristics of this nephron segment under physiological and pathophysiological settings.  \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA numerical model of acid-base transport in rat distal tubule, Hangil Chang and Toshiro Fujita, 2001, American Journal of Physiology, 281, F222-F243.

In excitable cells such as neurons, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is brought about by the Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane when these channels open during depolarisation, permitting extracellular Ca2+ to enter the cell.  By contrast, in non-excitable cells Ca2+ is supplied mainly by internal stores.  These stores release Ca2+ when neurotransmitters and hormones engage in the phospholinositide signalling pathway.\n\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nOscillatory signals in [Ca2+]i in non-excitable cells are frequency encoded.  These patterns are similar to action potential responses observed in excitable cells upon stimulation.  A model exclusively studied in this paper is based on the receptor-operated model of Cuthberson and Chay (1991) (see  below).  The essence of this model is that the resting period between the Ca2+ spikes are timed by the build up of GTP-binding proteins combined with positive feedback effects and co-operation, leading to the sudden activation of phospholipase C (PLC).  Activated PLC converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores (see  below).\n\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAppearance of phase-locked wenckebach-like rhythms, devil's staircase and universality in intracellular calcium spikes in non-excitable cell models, Teresa Ree Chay, Young Seek Lee and Yin Shui Fan, 1995, \n            Journal Of Theoretical Biology\n         , 174, 21-44.

A hypothetical molecular mechanism, potentially underlying cell cycle control in this organism, is outlined in \n    the figure\n   below.  However, these networks of interacting proteins are so complex that the functional integration of the network cannot be understood by intuition alone.  Mathematical models, which describe molecular interactions and reactions with biochemical rate equations, provide an integrative framework with which the complexities of molecular regulatory networks can be studied.  In the Chen et al. 2004 publication described here, the authors develop a mathematical model to analyse cell cycle control in budding yeast.  Model simulations reveal that the data generated by the model are in accord with the physiological properties of many genetic strains of budding yeast.

In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1-3 and Clb1-6) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling \"Start\" (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and \"Finish\" (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in budding yeast.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKinetic Analysis of a Molecular Model of the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, Katherine C.

        "description": "Model Status\n\nThis CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR and is known to be mathematically consistent with the publication it was based on. The units are consistent. An additional variable and equation has been added to allow the CellML model to reproduce Figure 2 of the publication. The three different graphs of this figure can be produced by altering the variable 'Fe3' in the 'Fe3' component (this variable represents the concentration of eNOS in its Fe3+ bound state) to 0.045, 0.030 or 0.015 micromolar. In this particular version of the model it has been set to 0.045.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nTheoretical analysis of biochemical pathways of nitric oxide release from vascular endothelial cells, Kejing Chen and Aleksander S.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        This CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR and is known to be mathematically consistent with the publication it was based on. The units are consistent. An additional variable and equation has been added to allow the CellML model to reproduce Figure 2 of the publication. The three different graphs of this figure can be produced by altering the variable 'Fe3' in the 'Fe3' component (this variable represents the concentration of NOS-1 in its Fe3+ bound state) to 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9 micromolar. In this particular version of the model it has been set to 0.6.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Nitric oxide (NO) derived from nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an important paracrine effector that maintains vascular tone. The release of NO mediated by NOS isozymes under various O(2) conditions critically determines the NO bioavailability in tissues. Because of experimental difficulties, there has been no direct information on how enzymatic NO production and distribution change around arterioles under various oxygen conditions. In this study, we used computational models based on the analysis of biochemical pathways of enzymatic NO synthesis and the availability of NOS isozymes to quantify the NO production by neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3). We compared the catalytic activities of NOS1 and NOS3 and their sensitivities to the concentration of substrate O(2). Based on the NO release rates predicted from kinetic models, the geometric distribution of NO sources, and mass balance analysis, we predicted the NO concentration profiles around an arteriole under various O(2) conditions. The results indicated that NOS1-catalyzed NO production was significantly more sensitive to ambient O(2) concentration than that catalyzed by NOS3. Also, the high sensitivity of NOS1 catalytic activity to O(2) was associated with significantly reduced NO production and therefore NO concentrations, upon hypoxia. Moreover, the major source determining the distribution of NO was NOS1, which was abundantly expressed in the nerve fibers and mast cells close to arterioles, rather than NOS3, which was expressed in the endothelium. Finally, the perivascular NO concentration predicted by the models under conditions of normoxia was paradoxically at least an order of magnitude lower than a number of experimental measurements, suggesting a higher abundance of NOS1 or NOS3 and/or the existence of other enzymatic or nonenzymatic sources of NO in the microvasculature.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nVascular and perivascular nitric oxide release and transport: biochemical pathways of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), Kejing Chen and Aleksander S.

It is embodied as a software package for use with Matlab\u2122 and Simulink that allows the creation of realistic musculotendon elements for use in motor control simulations. The software employs graphic user interfaces (GUI) and dynamic data exchange (DDE) to facilitate building custom muscle model blocks and linking them to kinetic analyses of complete musculoskeletal systems. It is scalable in complexity and accuracy. The model is based on recently published data on muscle and tendon properties measured in feline slow- and fast-twitch muscle, and incorporates a novel approach to simulating recruitment and frequency modulation of different fiber-types in mixed muscles.

Central to the checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive, its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis checkpoint, like other checkpoints, raises the cell size threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast, Andrea Ciliberto, Bela Novak, and John J.

Cdk1 activity peaks at mitosis, driven by periodic degradation of cyclins A and B. In contrast, Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, despite a constant level of its partner, cyclin E. Cyclin E degrades at a fixed time after fertilization, normally corresponding to the midblastula transition. Based on published data and new experiments, we constructed a mathematical model in which: (1) oscillations in Cdk2 activity depend upon changes in phosphorylation, (2) Cdk2 participates in a negative feedback loop with the inhibitory kinase Wee1; (3) cyclin E is cooperatively removed from the oscillatory system; and (4) removed cyclin E is degraded by a pathway activated by cyclin E/Cdk2 itself. The model's predictions about embryos injected with Xic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E/Cdk2, were experimentally validated.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA kinetic model of the cyclin E/Cdk2 developmental timer in Xenopus laevis embryos, Andrea Ciliberto, Matthew J.

S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, called the G1 and G2 phases respectively.  However, in early development, when the main aim of embryo is to increase cell number by a series of rapid cell divisions, the cell cycle has a number of unique features: \n\ninterdivision time is short and nearly constant;\nS and M phases alternate in time without intervening G1 or G2 phases;\ncell division is nearly synchronous and most cells take part;\nand the nucleocytoplasmic ration (NCR) of cells increases dramatically.\n\nIt is believed that the NCR controls the cell cycle characteristics during the early stages of devlopment.  This idea has been incorporated into the following mathematical model of early devlopmental cell cycle control. \n\n\nThe molecular components involved in mitotic control have been studied extensively in the last decade, and a control system, common to all eukaryotes, has been elucidated.

LQT2 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT interval on the ECG. METHODS: We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr) channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the cardiac ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect results in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the time course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG can lead to impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding of the link between channel structure and cellular function.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCellular consequences of HERG mutations in the long QT syndrome: precursors to sudden cardiac death, Colleen E.

For more details on the curation status of this model please see this separate notes document.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Complex physiological interactions determine the functional consequences of gene abnormalities and make mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes extremely difficult. A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.  \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nNa+ Channel Mutation That Causes Both Brugada and Long-QT Syndrome Phenotypes: A Simulation Study of Mechanism, Colleen E.

Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAn integrative dynamic model of brain energy metabolism using in vivo neurochemical measurements, Mathieu Cloutier, Fiachra B.

To this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations or perfect adaptation. Although the various mechanisms of energy regulation have been studied in detail from many angles at the experimental and theoretical levels, no framework is available for the systematic analysis of EM from a control systems perspective. In this study, we have used principles well known in control to clarify the basic system features that govern EM. The major result is a subdivision of the biomolecular mechanisms of energy regulation in terms of widely used engineering control mechanisms: proportional, integral, derivative control, and structures: feedback, cascade and feed-forward control. Evidence for each mechanism and structure is demonstrated and the implications for systems properties are shown through simulations. As the equivalence between biological systems and control components presented here is generic, it is also hypothesized that our work could eventually have an applicability that is much wider than the focus of the current study.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nThe control systems structures of energy metabolism, Mathieu Cloutier and Peter Wellstead, 2009, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2009.0371.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis model has been built using the expressions found in the Conradie's 2010 paper \"Restriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex\". This model was produced using the parameter values on page 360. This file is known to run on COR 0.9 and Open Cell.\nModel Structure\nNumerous top-down kinetic models have been constructed to describe the cell cycle. These models have typically been constructed, validated and analyzed using model species (molecular intermediates and proteins) and phenotypic observations, and therefore do not focus on the individual model processes (reaction steps). We have developed a method to: (a) quantify the importance of each of the reaction steps in a kinetic model for the positioning of a switch point [i.e. the restriction point (RP)]; (b) relate this control of reaction steps to their effects on molecular species, using sensitivity and co-control analysis; and thereby (c) go beyond a correlation towards a causal relationship between molecular species and effects. The method is generic and can be applied to responses of any type, but is most useful for the analysis of dynamic and emergent responses such as switch points in the cell cycle. The strength of the analysis is illustrated for an existing mammalian cell cycle model focusing on the RP [Novak B, Tyson J (2004) J Theor Biol230, 563-579]. The reactions in the model with the highest RP control were those involved in: (a) the interplay between retinoblastoma protein and E2F transcription factor; (b) those synthesizing the delayed response genes and cyclin D/Cdk4 in response to growth signals; (c) the E2F-dependent cyclin E/Cdk2 synthesis reaction; as well as (d) p27 formation reactions. Nine of the 23 intermediates were shown to have a good correlation between their concentration control and RP control. Sensitivity and co-control analysis indicated that the strongest control of the RP is mediated via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex concentration. Any perturbation of the RP could be related to a change in the concentration of this complex; apparent effects of other molecular species were indirect and always worked through cyclin E/Cdk2:p27, indicating a causal relationship between this complex and the positioning of the RP.\nRestriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex, Conradie R, Bruggeman F J, Ciliberto A, Csikasz-Nagy A, Novak B, Westerhoff H V, Snoep J L FEB Journal, 277, 357-367PubMed ID: 20015233\n",

        "description": "Model Status\n\n          This CellML version of the model has been encoded by the model author, Alberto Corrias, and is known to produce correct results in JSim and CellMLSimulator. It also passes the online PyCml validation tests with no errors or warnings. This model includes the specification of four pseudo ICC stimulus pulses with a 20s period. More information and simulation results can be found at the Computational Bioengineering Laboratory.\n        \nModel Structure\n\nThe coordinated activity of the enteric nervous system (ENS), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and smooth muscle (SM) cells is required to generate gastric motility.  While the ICC provide a constant source of electrical activity, and can be regarded as the pacemaker of the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the ENS adds an extra level of control.  In combination the ICC and ENS act as a stimulus, causing the SM cells to contract and generate slow wave activity in the GI.  These regular, autonomous depolarisations are then propagated via gap junctions to the neighbouring SM cells in the gut wall. \n\n\nSM cells themselves are unable to generate or propagate slow waves autonomously.  Instead they response to the electrical stimuli generated by neighbouring ICC as voltage-dependent ion channels embedded within their cell surface membrane become activated and other extracellular ligands and intracellular second messengers (such as calcium ions) also modify the response of the SM cells.  As such, the inherent complexity of such a system quickly becomes apparent, and the role of mathematical models in dissecting the system and characterising the different functions of each individual component becomes clear.  However, while computational models of cardiac electrophysiology have advanced considerably over the past few years, to date, models of gastric electrophysiology have been limited by the absence of single cell models which form the foundation for the more complex, large scale, integrated models.  \n\n\nIn the present study Alberto Corrias and Martin Buist address this issue by presenting an electrophysiolgical model of a single gastric SM cell.  The model parameters are based on real, experimentally recorded, physiological data, and the model has also been kept relatively simple to make it computationally efficient, and therefore suitable for embedding within multicellular simulations.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA quantitative model of gastric smooth muscle cellular activation, Alberto Corrias and Martin L.

The CellML model was created by Alberto Corrias and taken from the NUS Computational Bioengineering Laboratory website. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are responsible for the spontaneous and omnipresent electrical activity in the stomach. A quantitative description of the intracellular processes whose coordinated activity is believed to generate electrical slow waves has been developed and is presented here. In line with recent experimental evidence, the model describes how the interplay between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in cycling intracellular Ca2+ provides the primary regulatory signal for the initiation of the slow wave. The major ion channels that have been identified as influencing slow wave activity have been modeled according to data obtained from isolated ICC. The model has been validated by comparing the simulated profile of the slow waves with experimental recordings and shows good correspondence in terms of frequency, amplitude, and shape in both control and pharmacologically altered conditions.\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQuantitative cellular description of gastric slow wave activity, Alberto Corrias, Martin L.

Unfortunately the model will not integrate at the moment.  We are working with the model author to complete the curation of this model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nThe high metabolic rate of cardiac tissue necessitates close agreement between the rates of energy production and consumption.  About 2 percent of cellular ATP is consumed per heartbeat, and under normal conditions, almost all of this energy is provided by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.  Although the chemiosmotic theory of energy transduction was developed by Michell in 1961, remarkably little has since been elucidated about the mechanisms underlying the control of mitochondrial metabolism.  \n\n\nThe thermokinetic model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics (see \n    the figure\n   below).  The kinetic portion of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH2.  In turn, these are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force driving the F1F0-ATPase.  In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, determined by Ca2+ uniporter and Ca2+/Na+ exchanger activities, controls the activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.  Model simulations are used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of ATP/ADP exchange, and Ca2+ concentration.  Model simulations are able to reproduce experimental data, which was taken as supporting evidence for the validity of the model.  The steady-state and time-dependent behaviour of the model supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.     \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n+\n2+\n2+\n\nPreviously published models of mitochondrial energetics include the models of pancreatic beta-cell mitochondrial metabolism by Magnus and Keizer (see Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling Model, 1997).  An oxidative phosphorylation model has been developed by Korzeniewski (see The Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway, 2001).  However, these models, in common with other previously developed models of mitochondrial energetics, fail to include all the necessary variables.  Together with the desire to improve understanding of mitochondrial metabolism, this has led Cortassa et al. to develop an integrated kinetic and thermodynamic model of cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism.  Their model has been described here in CellML (the raw CellML description of the Cortassa et al. model can be downloaded in various formats as described in ).     \n\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAn Integrated Model of Cardiac Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism and Calcium Dynamics, Sonia Cortassa, Miguel A.

Cell-wide synchronized oscillations in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), NADH, and ROS production have been recently described in isolated cardiomyocytes, and we have hypothesized that the balance between superoxide anion efflux through inner membrane anion channels and the intracellular ROS scavenging capacity play a key role in the oscillatory mechanism. Here, we formally test the hypothesis using a computational model of mitochondrial energetics and Ca(2+) handling including mitochondrial ROS production, cytoplasmic ROS scavenging, and ROS activation of inner membrane anion flux. The mathematical model reproduces the period and phase of the observed oscillations in Delta Psi(m), NADH, and ROS. Moreover, we experimentally verify model predictions that the period of the oscillator can be modulated by altering the concentration of ROS scavengers or the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, and that the redox state of the glutathione pool oscillates. In addition to its role in cellular dysfunction during metabolic stress, the period of the oscillator can be shown to span a wide range, from milliseconds to hours, suggesting that it may also be a mechanism for physiological timekeeping and/or redox signaling.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mitochondrial Oscillator Dependent on Reactive Oxygen Species, Sonia Cortassa, Miguel A.

A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools. These receptor properties enable the system to cope with basal and acute demand in the hematopoietic system.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n'Covering a Broad Dynamic Range: Information Processing at the \nErythropoietin Receptor', Verena Becker, Marcel Schilling, Julie Bachmann, Ute Baumann, Andreas Raue, \nThomas Maiwald, Jens Timmer, Ursula Klingm\u00fcller, 2010 Science, 234, 1-35.

The model does not currently reproduce the published results, possibly due to missing parameter values in the paper. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Glycerol, a major by-product of ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is of significant importance to the wine, beer, and ethanol production industries. To gain a clearer understanding of and to quantify the extent to which parameters of the pathway affect glycerol flux in S. cerevisiae, a kinetic model of the glycerol synthesis pathway has been constructed. Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (C(J)v1) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (R(J)DHAP= 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (R(J)ATP = -0.21 to -0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (R(J)NADH = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMetabolic Control Analysis of Glycerol Synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n          , Garth R.

The idiosyncrasies of cell cycle regulation in particular organisms \ncan be attributed, we claim, to specific settings of rate constants in the dynamic network of chemical reactions. The values of \nthese rate constants are determined ultimately by the genetic makeup of an organism. To support these claims, we convert the \nreaction mechanism into a set of governing kinetic equations and provide parameter values (specific to budding yeast, fission \nyeast, frog eggs, and mammalian cells) that account for many curious features of cell cycle regulation in these organisms. Using \none-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell cycle, how cell-size \nhomeostasis can be achieved by two different strategies, and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual \ncell-division phenotypes. The relation between gene dosage and phenotype can be summarized compactly in two-parameter \nbifurcation diagrams. Our approach provides a theoretical framework in which to understand both the universality and \nparticularity of cell cycle regulation, and to construct, in modular fashion, increasingly complex models of the networks \ncontrolling cell growth and division.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnalysis of a Generic Model of Eukaryotic Cell-Cycle Regulation, Attila Csikasz-Nagy, Dorjsuren Battogtokh, Katherine C.

In this particular version of the model the zinc-buffering effects of TPEN are NOT considered.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli is one of the most intensively studied prokaryotic zinc homeostasis systems. Its underlying regulatory machine consists of repression on zinc influx through ZnuABC by Zur (Zn2+ uptake regulator) and activation on zinc efflux via ZntA by ZntR (a zinc-responsive regulator). Although these transcriptional regulations seem to be well characterized, and there is an abundance of detailed in vitro experimental data available, as yet there is no mathematical model to help interpret these data. To our knowledge, the work described here is the first attempt to use a mathematical model to simulate these regulatory relations and to help explain the in vitro experimental data. RESULTS: We develop a unified mathematical model consisting of 14 reactions to simulate the in vitro transcriptional response of the zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. Firstly, we simulate the in vitro Zur-DNA interaction by using two of these reactions, which are expressed as 4 ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By imposing the conservation restraints and solving the relevant steady state equations, we find that the simulated sigmoidal curve matches the corresponding experimental data. Secondly, by numerically solving the ODEs for simulating the Zur and ZntR run-off transcription experiments, and depicting the simulated concentrations of zntA and znuC transcripts as a function of free zinc concentration, we find that the simulated curves fit the corresponding in vitro experimental data. Moreover, we also perform simulations, after taking into consideration the competitive effects of ZntR with the zinc buffer, and depict the simulated concentration of zntA transcripts as a function of the total ZntR concentration, both in the presence and absence of Zn(II). The obtained simulation results are in general agreement with the corresponding experimental data. CONCLUSION: Simulation results show that our model can quantitatively reproduce the results of several of the in vitro experiments conducted by Outten CE and her colleagues. Our model provides a detailed insight into the dynamics of the regulatory system and also provides a general framework for simulating in vitro metal-binding and transcription experiments and interpreting the relevant experimental data.\n\n\nIn 1999-2001, Outten et al. published a series of papers presenting data from several in vitro transcription and metal-binding competition experiments in E. coli.  These studies provide a detailed data set on which a mathematical model can be based.  In the study described here, Cui and Kaandorp have developed such a mathematical model, and they use it to simulate the in vitro transcriptional response of zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. Cellerator, an open source software, was used to automatically generate the equations, and the model was subsequently translated into CellML to facilitate future model exchange, reuse and implementation.   \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nJiangjun Cui, Jaap A.

Also the CellML model appears to match the published equations.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: This work proposes a model of the metabolic branch-point between the methionine and threonine biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana which involves kinetic competition for phosphohomoserine between the allosteric enzyme threonine synthase and the two-substrate enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase. Threonine synthase is activated by S-adenosylmethionine and inhibited by AMP. Cystathionine gamma-synthase condenses phosphohomoserine to cysteine via a ping-pong mechanism. Reactions are irreversible and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. The modelling procedure included an examination of the kinetic links, the determination of the operating conditions in chloroplasts and the establishment of a computer model using the enzyme rate equations. To test the model, the branch-point was reconstituted with purified enzymes. The computer model showed a partial agreement with the in vitro results. The model was subsequently improved and was then found consistent with flux partition in vitro and in vivo. Under near physiological conditions, S-adenosylmethionine, but not AMP, modulates the partition of a steady-state flux of phosphohomoserine. The computer model indicates a high sensitivity of cystathionine flux to enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Cystathionine flux is sensitive to modulation of threonine flux whereas the reverse is not true. The cystathionine gamma-synthase kinetic mechanism favours a low sensitivity of the fluxes to cysteine. Though sensitivity to inorganic phosphate is low, its concentration conditions the dynamics of the system. Threonine synthase and cystathionine gamma-synthase display similar kinetic efficiencies in the metabolic context considered and are first-order for the phosphohomoserine substrate. Under these conditions outflows are coordinated. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Kinetic Model of the Branch-Point between the Methionine and Threonine Biosynthesis Pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana\n          , Gilles Curien, Stephane Ravanel and Renaud Dumas, 2003, \n            European Journal of Biochemistry \n         , 270, 4615-4627.

It has been shown that successive additions of low concentrations of InsP3 causes successive rapid transients of Ca2+ release.  Two hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, either:\n\n2+\n2+\nCells contain a series of Ca2+ stores of various sensitivities to InsP3, such that at any given concentration of InsP3, only some stores will release their Ca2+, whilst others remain intact.  This is also known as the all-or-nothing model; or \n2+\n2+\nInsP3 receptors are able to adapt to a particular InsP3 concentration, such that at a given [InsP3], all the Ca2+ stores partially empty.  Because partial emptying induces faster cycling of Ca2+ across the store membrane via the SERCA pump, this theory is also known as the steady-state model.\n2+\n2+\n\nThere are sets of experimental data in support of both explanations.  The two theories require very different mechanisms.  The all-or-nothing model not only requires differing sensitivities of stores to InsP3, but also a high degree of cooperativity such that a small range of InsP3 concentrations will empty a particular store whilst leaving others unaffected.  Differences in sensitivity could be due to structural differences, differences in InsP3 density, intracellular cell environment, or luminal [Ca2+].  In contrast, the steady-state model seems to require complex, adaptive kinetic changes in the receptor.  Mathematical steady-state models have been developed and in general they involve effects of Ca2+ binding to sites within the channel or to sites in the channel mouth, although there is also evidence that the InsP3 receptor can show adaptive behaviour.   \n\n2+\n2+\n\nModels of adaptive behaviour at the single channel level have been developed for the structurally homologous ryanodine receptor.  It has been suggested that similar mechanisms account for the behaviour of the InsP3 receptor.  Using the Sachs et al. ryanodine receptor model as a foundation, Dawson et al. develop such a model.  They begin with a relatively simple situation with no Ca2+ fluxes (see ), to more complex situations which account for the positive and negative feedback from Ca(cyt), and the inactivation of the receptor in the presence of Ca2+ (see  and ).  This final model is an adaptive model of the InsP3 receptor that can show either all-or-nothing or steady-state behaviour, depending on the experimental conditions.  The model suggests that the receptor has two interconvertible conformational states: one that rapidly binds InsP3 but has a low affinity for the ligand, while the other state binds slowly but with a high affinity.  \n\n2+\n2+\n\nThe models have been described here in CellML (the raw CellML description of the Dawson et al. 2003 models can be downloaded in various formats as described in ).     \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nKinetic model of the inositol trisphosphate receptor that shows both steady-state and quantal patterns of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, Alan P.

Isolated beta -cells, however, exhibit atypical bursting or continuous spike activity. We study bursting as an emergent property of the population, focussing on interactions among the subclass of spiking cells. These are modelled by equipping the fast subsystem with a saddle-node-loop bifurcation, which makes it monostable. Such cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over which bursting is seen.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nChannel Sharing in Pancreatic Beta-Cells Revisited: Enhancement of Emergent Bursting by Noise, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman, 2000,\n            The Journal Of Theoretical Biology\n          , 207, 513-530.

Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation.  At even higher glucose concentrations, continuous action potentials are seen.  This electrical activity has two important physiological correlates: increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and increased rate of insulin secretion during the active phase.  It is generally accepted that the rise in [Ca2+]i plays a major role in insulin secretion and that the action potential spikes during a burst are responsible for the rise in [Ca2+]i.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nNormal bursting patterns are only observed when the beta-cells act synchronously, as they do in vivo, in electrically coupled organs called the islets of Langerhans.  Isolated spiking cells, incapable of bursting by themselves, may generate islet-like bursting rhythms when coupled.  There are three alternative hypotheses to explain why single cells and islets are different.  One of these emphasises heterogeneity: single cell properties are variable, and individual cells may fall outside the narrow parameter regime required for bursting.  By contrast, in coupled populations, cells with an excess of current can be balanced by cells with too little, and the population is more likely to achieve bursting.  A second hypothesis focuses on noise from stochastic channel fluctuations in individual cells preventing bursting by causing premature transitions between active and silent phases.  However, in large populations, fluctuations are buffered, allowing the underlying burst dynamics to be dominant.  A third alternative discusses the paracrine effects of glucagon secreted by alpha-cells in the islet, on beta-cells.\n\n  \nIn their 2001 paper, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman contrast the first two hypotheses.  They introduce a mathematical model for bursting in pancreatic beta-cells, which is a simplified version of the biophysically based, earlier model by Sherman and Rinzel (1992).  This model describes three ionic currents (see \n    the figure\n   below): a fast voltage-activated calcium current, ICa; a delayed rectifier potassium current, IK; and a very slow inhibitory potassium current,  Is.  The calcium and delayed rectifier potassium currents are responsible for generating action potentials.  The slow potassium current plays no essential role in the individual cells but heterogeneity among the cells is generated by varying the value of the parameter beta.  Parameter values were chosen such that the individual cells are incapable of bursting.  De Vries and Sherman use their model to show bifurcation in a two-cell system, and they extrapolate this for larger clusters of coupled cells.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nFrom Spikers to Bursters Via Coupling: Help From Heterogeneity, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman, 2001,\n            Bulletin of Mathematical Biology\n         , 63, 371-391.

This work presents a new model of the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)), the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)), the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK). Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia). Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic targets.\n                \n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nProperties and ionic mechanisms of action potential adaptation, restitution, and accommodation in canine epicardium, Keith F.

Physiol. 266 (Cell Physiol. 35): C832-C852, 1994] of the single rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cell so that it can simulate cellular responses to bath applications of ACh and isoprenaline as well as the effects of neuronally released ACh. The model employs three different types of muscarinic receptors to explain the variety of responses observed in mammalian cardiac pacemaking cells subjected to vagal stimulation. The response of greatest interest is the ACh-sensitive change in cycle length that is not accompanied by a change in action potential duration or repolarization or hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. In this case, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is not involved. Membrane hyperpolarization occurs in response to much higher levels of vagal stimulation, and this response is also mimicked by the model. Here, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is involved. The well-known phase-resetting response of the SAN cell to single and periodically applied vagal bursts of impulses is also simulated in the presence and absence of the beta-agonist isoprenaline. Finally, the responses of the SAN cell to longer continuous trains of periodic vagal stimulation are simulated, and this can result in the complete cessation of pacemaking. Therefore, this model is 1) applicable over the full range of intensity and pattern of vagal input and 2) can offer biophysically based explanations for many of the phenomena associated with the autonomic control of cardiac pacemaking.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nParasympathetic modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity in rabbit heart: a unifying model, Semahat S.

Original features of this model include 1) new equations for the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, 2) assessment of the role of the transient-type Ca2+ current during pacemaker depolarization, 3) inclusion of an Na+ current based on recent experimental data, and 4) demonstration of the possible influence of pump and exchanger currents and background currents on the pacemaker rate.

All parameter values are set to the same as those in table 1, with the exception of P=0.052 and Q=0.042.

To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to the secretion of cortisol, a mechanistic mathematical model based on current hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which provides substrate cholesterol by activating cholesterol ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, cholesterol modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this model, steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport. The transient response is dominated by a depletable pool of intracellular free cholesterol. Other inferences based on the model are presented, and a quantifiable cellular basis for increased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is proposed.\n\n\nA mechanistic model of ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion, D.P.

It is based on 3 different models: the a model is the goldbeter_1995 model and the b model is the leloup_gonze_goldbeter_1999b model. Both are available in the CellMl model repository. The c model comes from this paper and is based on equations 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 in the published paper.\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Circadian rhythms, which occur spontaneously with a period of about 24 h in a variety \nof organisms, allow their adaptation to the periodic variations of the environment. These \nrhythms are generated by a genetic regulatory network involving a negative feedback \nloop on transcription. Mathematical models based on the negative autoregulation of \ngene expression by the protein product of a clock gene account for the occurrence of self- \nsustained circadian oscillations. These models differ by their degree of complexity and, \nhence, by the number of variables considered. Some of these models can be considered as \nminimal because they contain a reduced number of biochemical processes and variables \ncapable of producing sustained oscillations. In three of these minimal models, the period \nof the oscillations significantly changes with the rate of degradation of the clock protein. \nHowever, depending on the model considered, the period increases, decreases or passes \nthrough a maximum as a function of the protein degradation rate. We clarify the \nbases for these markedly different results by bringing to light the roles of (i) protein \nphosphorylation, which is required for protein degradation, and (ii) the velocity and \ndegree of saturation of mRNA and protein degradation. Changes in the parameter values \nof the more complex of the minimal models can produce the period profiles observed in \nthe other two models. The analysis allows us to reconcile the contradictory predictions \nfor the dependence of the period on the clock protein degradation rate in three minimal \nmodels used to describe circadian rhythms. \n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDependence of the period on the rate \nof protein degradation in minimal models \nfor circadian oscillations , Claude Gerard, Didier Gonze, Albert Goldbeter, 2009, Phil.

PubMed ID: 2578676\n\n\nThe membrane physically contains the currents, exchangers and pumps, as indicated by the blue arrows in . The currents act independently and are not connected to each other. Several of the channels encapsulate and contain further components which represent activation and inactivation gates. The addition of an encapsulation relationship informs modellers and processing software that the gates are important parts of the current model. It also prevents any other components that aren't also encapsulated by the parent component from connecting to its gates, effectively hiding them from the rest of the model.\n\n\nThe breakdown of the model into components and the definition of encapsulation and containment relationships between them is somewhat arbitrary. When considering how a model should be broken into components, modellers are encouraged to consider which parts of a model might be re-used and how the physiological elements of the system being modelled are naturally bounded. Containment relationships should be used to provide simple rendering information for processing software (ideally, this will correspond to the layout of the physical system), and encapsulation should be used to group sets of components into sub-models.\n",

In order to balance the units in a couple of equations a \"balancing factor\" had to be introduced (eqs 4.13 and 14.36). Also note there are two typographical errors in the published paper: eq 1.1 should be C_Pd = Q_Pd/V_Ru (not C_Pd = Q_Pd*V_Ru) and eq 8.2 P_Fu_InFu = Y_Fu_InFu*D_Fu (not P_Fu_InFu = U_Fu_InFu*D_Fu). Finally there are quite a few variables with undefined values. To complete the CellML model, where parameter values were missing, a value of 1.000 has been used. Note that there are some genuine values of 1. These have been entered as just 1 or 1.0.

The model consists of 17 state variables, representing nitrogen, carbohydrate, lipid, microbial and volatile fatty acid pools. The flux equations are described by Michaelis-Menten or mass action forms with model_parameters calculated from the literature. Several specific areas of improvement in representation of rumen processes were reconsidered during model development. These included microbial substrate preference, differential outflow and chemical composition of rumen microbes, recycling of microbial matter within the rumen, uncoupling of fermentation with respect to nitrogen availability, reduced microbial activity at reduced rumen pH and pH-dependent absorption of volatile fatty acids and ammonia. The model was used to examine the effects of the diet on the profile of nutrients available for absorption and was shown to respond appropriately to different intake and nitrogen levels. The validity of the improvements and the predictions of nutrient supply on a variety of dietary inputs are tested in a companion paper.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSimulation of nutrient digestion, absorption and outflow in the rumen: model description, Dijkstra J, Neal HD, Beever DE, and France J, 1992, The Journal of Nutrition, 122, 2239-2256.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n    \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The ionic currents underlying autorhythmicity of the mammalian sinoatrial node and their wider contribution to each phase of the action potential have been investigated in this study using a new single cell mathematical model. The new model provides a review and update of existing formulations of sinoatrial node membrane currents, derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature. Simulations of spontaneous activity suggest that the dominant mechanism underlying pacemaker depolarisation is the inward background Na+ current, ib,Na. In contrast to previous models, the decay of the delayed rectifying K+ current, iK, was insignificant during this phase. Despite the presence of a pseudo-outward background current throughout the pacemaker range of potentials (Na-K pump+leak currents), the hyperpolarisation-activated current i(f) was not essential to pacemaker activity. A closer inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of the model revealed that the \"instantaneous\" time-independent current was inward for holding potentials in the pacemaker range, which rapidly became outward within 2 ms due to the inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, iCa,L. This suggests that reports in the literature in which the net background current is outward throughout the pacemaker range of potentials may be exaggerated. The magnitudes of the action potential overshoot and the maximum diastolic potential were determined largely by the reversal potentials of iCa,L and iK respectively. The action potential was sustained by the incomplete deactivation of iCa,L and the Na-Ca exchanger, iNaCa. Despite the incorporation of \"square-root\" activation by [K]o of all K+ currents, the model was unable to correctly simulate the response to elevated [K]o.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIon Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity: A New Single Cell Mathematical Model, Socrates Dokos, Branko Celler, and Nigel Lovell, 1996, \n            Theoretical Journal of Biology\n          , 181, 245-272.

About half of these cases are attributed to the Brugada syndrome, which is characterised by an ST-segment elevation in V1 through V3 and a rapid VT that can degenerate into VF.  The disease has been linked to mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel.  This temperature dependent mutation appears to change the gating kinetics of the sodium channel, such that the net outward current is augmented during the early phases of the right ventricular action potential.\n\n\nIn their 1999 study, Dumaine et al. tested this temperature dependence hypothesis.  They studied cardiac action potentials by using a modified version of the Luo-Rudy II model.  The modification involved adding a transient outward potassium current (Ito\n) to the original model, and reducing the conductance of the L-type calcium channel by 20 to 50 percent.  For a diagram of the model, please see the figure below.  \n\n\nThe results of their study showed that this mutation is only expressed at physiological temperatures.  This explained why the mutation phenotype had not been observed in previous experiments which had been carried out at room temperature.  Their findings also suggest that some patients may be more at risk during febrile states when their body temperature is elevated.  \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIonic Mechanisms Responsible for the Electrocardiographic Phenotype of the Brugada Syndrome Are Temperature Dependent, Robert Dumaine, Jeffrey A.

This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR, and parameters for constants (beta) can be altered to produce all diagrams of figure 2 in the paper. The current parameterization is set to reproduce beta = 60% (0.6). The initial conditions Z = 0.52 and Y = 0.93 were found by allowing the model to run till steady state at 100 seconds.\nModel Structure\nWe consider a simple, minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The model takes into account the existence of two pools of intracellular Ca2+, namely, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) whose synthesis is elicited by the stimulus, and one insensitive to InsP3. The discharge of the latter pool into the cytosol is activated by cytosolic Ca2+. Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ arise in this model either spontaneously or in an appropriate range of external stimulation; these oscillations do not require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The following properties of the model are reviewed and compared with experimental observations: (a) Control of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations by the external stimulus or extracellular Ca2+; (b) correlation of latency with period of Ca2+ oscillations obtained at different levels of stimulation; (c) effect of a transient increase in InsP3; (d) phase shift and transient suppression of Ca2+ oscillations by Ca2+ pulses, and (e) propagation of Ca2+ waves. It is shown that on all these counts the model provides a simple, unified explanation for a number of experimental observations in a variety of cell types. The model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release can be extended to incorporate variations in the level of InsP3 as well as desensitization of the InsP3 receptor; besides accounting for the phenomena described by the minimal model, the extended model might also account for the occurrence of complex Ca2+ oscillations.\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n                              Signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations: properties of a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, Dupont G, Berridge M.J, Goldbeter A, 1991, Cell Calcium\n                              12, 73-85.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis model has been built with the differential expressions in Dupont and Goldbeter's 1992 paper. This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR, and variables for constants (K1 and K2) can be altered to produce all cases of figure 4 in the paper. The current parameterization is set to reproduce K1=K2 = 0.01 (note the erratum received in 1995: figure4c is produced by K1=K2=1, and not 10 as stated in the paper). Initial conditions for Z, Y and Wstar were set by letting the model settle into a steady state.\nModel Structure\nAbstract: Given the ubiquitous nature of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations, the question arises as to how cellular responses are affected by repetitive Ca2+ spikes. Among these responses, we focus on those involving protein phosphorylation. We examine, by numerical simulations of a theoretical model, the situation where a protein is phosphorylated by a Ca2+-activated kinase and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase. This reversible phosphorylation system is coupled to a mechanism generating cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations; for definiteness, this oscillatory mechanism is based on the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The analysis shows that the average fraction of phosphorylated protein increases with the frequency of repetitive Ca2+ spikes; the latter frequency generally rises with the extent of external stimulation. Protein phosphorylation therefore provides a mechanism for the encoding of the external stimulation in terms of the frequency of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Such a frequency encoding requires precise kinetic conditions on the Michaelis-Menten constants of the kinase and phosphatase, their maximal rates, and the degree of cooperativity in kinase activation by Ca2+. In particular, the most efficient encoding of Ca2+ oscillations based on protein phosphorylation occurs in conditions of zero-order ultrasensitivity, when the kinase and phosphatase are saturated by their protein substrate. The kinetic analysis uncovers a wide variety of temporal patterns of phosphorylation that could be driven by signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations.\nThe riginal paper reference is cited below:\n\n                              Protein phosphorylation driven by intracellular calcium oscillations: A kinetic analysis, Dupont G, Goldbeter A 1992, Biophysical Chemistry\n                              41, 257-270.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The hypothesis that calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac muscle is induced by rises in free cytosolic calcium (Fabiato 1983, Am. J. Physiol 245) allows the possibility that the release could be at least partly regenerative. There would then be a non-linear relation between calcium current and calcium release. We have investigated this possibility in a single-cell version of the rabbit-atrial model developed by Hilgemann & Noble (1987, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 230). The model predicts different voltage ranges of activation for calcium-dependent processes (like the sodium-calcium exchange current, contraction or Fura-2 signals) and the calcium current, in agreement with the experimental results obtained by Earm et al. (1990, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 240) on exchange current tails, Cannell et al. (1987, Science, Wash. 238) by using Fura-2 signals, and Fedida et al. (1987, J. Physiol., Lond. 385) and Talo et al. (1988, Biology of isolated adult cardiac myocytes) by using contraction. However, when the Fura-2 concentration is sufficiently high (greater than 200 microM) the activation ranges become very similar as the buffering properties of Fura-2 are sufficient to remove the regenerative effect. It is therefore important to allow for the buffering properties of calcium indicators when investigating the correlation between calcium current and calcium release.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of the single atrial cell: relation between calcium current and calcium release, Y.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Prolactin (PRL) is secreted from lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland of rats in a unique pattern in response to uterine cervical stimulation (CS) during mating. Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this study, we characterized the role of oxytocin (OT) in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased intracellular Ca(2+). Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that express VIP receptors were identified by using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold (iv injected). OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent increase at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that VIP from the SCN contributes to the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of neuroendocrine dopaminergic and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of VIP-ergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a mathematical model.\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Egli et al. present a mathematical model of the mechanisms regulating the rhythmic secretion of prolactin in rats (see figure below).  In this model the SCN acts as a pacemaker, controlling the activity of the hypothalamic DA and OT neurons via its rhythmic VIP secretion.  In turn, the activity of these DA and OT neurons combine to determine the PRL secretory pattern.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRhythmic secretion of prolactin in rats: action of oxytocin coordinated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide of suprachiasmatic nucleus origin, Marcel Egli, Richard Bertram, Michael T.

Details about the project can be found here.\n\nDevice 1 produces TF via a constitutive promoter, which combines with S to form a transcription factor for Device 2 (TFS). TFS produces PhzM and PhzS, intermediates to producing PYO which is the reducing agent of interest in this model.\nModel Output\nThere are two versions of this model, the first has a positive feedback loop from Device 2, shown as a CDS for TF downstream of Device 2's promoter. Thus Device 2 produces more TF which feedsback on the Device's promoter. The second version does not have the RBS and CDS for TF in Device 2.\nThe Figure below shows the PYO time-courses for the models, one without the TF feedback, and one with.\n\nModel Files\nThe entire model archive can be downloaded, or a ZIP file encapsulating all the files can been obtained from here.\nModel Architecture\nThe numbers on the Figure above relate to imported components.

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nWe used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed\nthe repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of\nits state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the\nstate of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly\nbecause of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of\nnew cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\nA synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators, Michael B.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n           This model is known to run in both OpenCell and COR, although there are no figures in the paper with which to compare the CellML model simulation output. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nBlood testosterone levels in human males are known to oscillate periodically with a period of a few hours.  Testosterone secretion from the testes is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and the production of LH is, in turn, stimulated by the hypothalamic hormone luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) (as summarised in the figure below).  Interestingly, the observed fluctuations in the blood levels of testosterone can be traced back to the pulsatile release of LHRH.  Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe the pulsatile release of these three hormones.  Some of these models depend on an introduced delay in one of the variables in order to create oscillations in an otherwise stable model.  Examples of such delayed mathematical models include those published by Cartwright and Husain (1980) which describes the control of testosterone secretion, and also the model published by Lenbury and Pornsawad (2005) to characterise feedback control in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in humans.  Both of these models have been translated into CellML and can be found in the model repository.  However, while delayed models can be biologically realistic (for example there is often a delay between the secretion of a hormone and the binding of that hormone to its receptor and the subsequent response), introducing a delay to a mathematical model often comes at the expense of increased model complexity.  (In particular, it should be noted that in its current form, CellML is unable to express time delays). \n\n\nIn the paper described here, Enciso and Sontag critique published mathematical models which describe testosterone dynamics.  In particular they highlight how models which use time delays to create hormone oscillations can exhibit stability.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nOn the stability of a model of testosterone dynamics, German Enciso and Eduardo D.

One cell is described by two nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations, with ten constant parameters. The model is much simpler than most other models in use, but can reproduce perfectly experimentally recorded action potentials. The dynamics of two coupled cells, with and without the presence of periodic acetylcholine pulses, shows examples of bifurcations and strange attractors, mathematical phenomena characterizing chaotic motion.

This model does not yet recreate all the published results.\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: This study investigates the reverse mode of the Na/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1). In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na- and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30-50 mV), and approached zero at -150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for aMDG-evoked outward current (K_0.5_aMDG) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, K_0.5_aMDG for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). K_0.5_Na was similar for forward and reverse transport (~ 35mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: aMDG (1.0) > D-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > D-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: aMDG ~ D-glucose ~ D-galactose > 3-O-methylglucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations. Our data indicate that under physiological conditions, the transporter is poised to accumulate sugar efficiently in the enterocyte.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKinetics of the Reverse Mode of the Na+/Glucose Cotransporter, S.Eskandari, E.M.

The model is valid CellML, and the units have been checked and they are consistent.  This version of the model is for a healthy heart.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nChronic exposure of adult rats to a simulated altitude of 4500 meters is accompanied by right ventricular hypertrophy which is, at least, partially attributable to an enlargement of right ventricular myocytes. This work contributes to the understanding of cardiovascular system modifications induced by changes in the atmospheric environment.\n\n\nHypertrophied myocytes show an important increase in action potential duration, particularly at the delayed phase of the repolarisation. Although it is well known that Ito and ICaL are decreased in hypertrophied rats, we hypothesized that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current could be implied in the prolongation of action potential duration in hypertrophied cells. The electrophysiological study of myocytes was achieved using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. This configuration was obtained in two ways: the conventional broken patch technique, which allows to control the internal medium composition and to buffer the intracellular calcium, and the perforated patch technique which allows to respect the internal composition of each cell.\n\n\nIn order to test for the implication of Na+/Ca2+ exchange current, we compared the action potentials obtained in control and in hypertrophied cells, in ionic conditions where the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was either present or blocked.\n\n\nThe Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current measured in voltage clamp conditions was also compared in control and hypertrophied cells.\n\n\nOur results clearly show and implication of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current in the prolongation of action potentials recorded in hypertrophied cells. Concerning the underlying mechanisms, the voltage clamp experiments show that the increased exchanger current is induced by a modification of the driving force for the exchanger rather than by a modification of \u201cconductance\u201d or density of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger proteins. The modification of the driving force could be induced by a change in the regulation of calcium concentration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum or by the action potential duration itself.\n\n\nThe experimental data acquired in this study, were used in a mathematical simulation of the action potential (Oxsoft Heart model). One of the most interesting result obtained by this method is the high implication of a persistent sodium current in the hypertrophied cell action potentials.\n\n\nThis model was taken from the PhD thesis of Leon Espinosa:\n\n\nL'Echange Na+ /Ca2+ dans l'Hypertrophie Ventriculaire D'Altitude chez le Rat: Etude Electrophysiologique et Utilisation du Modele \"Oxsoft Heart\", Leon Espinosa, 1998.\n",

With this aim in mind, Evans et al. propose a compartmental model for the anti-cancer agent topotecan (TPT).  The mathematical equations used to describe the physiological processes are based on biological assumptions, and the model parameters are estimated using high performance liquid chromatograpy data.\n\n\nTPT is a water soluble anti-cancer drug which has been approved for use against ovarian and small cell lung carcinomas.  The drug's molecular target is DNA topoismerase I, an enzyme which resolves topological distortions in DAN by cleavage and re-ligation of one strand of the double stranded helix.  TPT administration traps topoismerase I in a covalently bound intermediate complex with DNA.  When the DNA replication machinary collides with this complex, the double stranded DNA breaks apart.  \n\n\nThe activity of TPT is pH dependent.  AT physiological pH the active form of the agent is not stable, and it undergoes reversible hydrolisis to form the more stable, inactive form.  The reversible hydrolisis of TPT is first modelled by a linear, two compartment model.  This simple model then forms the basis of a cell based model for drug activity in live cell experiments (see \n    the figure\n   below).  \n\n\nThe cell based model has been described here in CellML (the raw CellML description of the Evans et al. 2004 model can be downloaded in various formats as described in ).     \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model for the in vitro kinetics of the anti-cancer agent topotecan, Neil D.

Note that this is the model in steady state and it is the original Faber Rudy model from 2000.\n          \nModel Structure\nABSTRACT:  Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAction potential and contractility changes in [Na(+)](i) overloaded cardiac myocytes: a simulation study, Gregory M.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            In this version of the Faber and Rudy 2000 model of a mammalian ventricular cardiomyocyte, the ICaT is reformulated to describe the biophysical characteristics that are more commonly ascribed to this current. The CellML equations are validated using OpenCell and all units are consistent. The model can be run in both OpenCell (version 0.8) and OpenCOR (version 0.4) environments. \n          \nModel Structure\n The original formulation of ICaT did not describe the current correctly so we replaced it with a new formulation. All the other model components, and the abstract below, remain the same as the original Faber and Rudy 2000 model.  \n\nABSTRACT:  Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.\n\n\nThe references for the papers containing this information are cited below:\n\n\nComputational modeling of inhibition of voltage-gated Ca channels: identification of different effects on uterine and cardiac action potentials.

The units have been checked and are consistent. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Multisubunit cytokine receptors such as the heterotrimeric receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2) are ubiquitous in hematopoeitic cell types of importance in biotechnology and are crucial regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation behavior. Dynamics of cytokine/receptor endocytic trafficking can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor down-regulation and ligand depletion, and in turn are governed by ligand/receptor binding properties. We describe here a computational model for trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) system, which is able to predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic equations describing binding, internalization, and postendocytic sorting of IL-2 and IL-2R, including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal pH, as a result of enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-a-vis degradation, and that an IL-2 analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency for stimulating the T cell proliferation response. These results are in agreement with our recent experimental findings for the IL-2 analogue termed 2D1 [Fallon, E. M. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 6790-6797]. Thus, this type of model may enable prediction of beneficial cytokine/receptor binding properties to aid development of molecular design criteria for improvements in applications such as in vivo cytokine therapies and in vitro hematopoietic cell bioreactors.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComputational Model for Effects of Ligand/Receptor Binding Properties on Interleukin-2 Trafficking Dynamics and T Cell Proliferation Response, Eric M.

Please note this particular version of the model is specific to females and also GHRH alone is being injected.  To simulate the injection of GHS and L-arginine the CellML model will have to be adapted slightly - this is relatively simple to do and will require changing a few initial conditions and parameters according to the description in the original paper. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Models of physiological systems facilitate rational experimental design, inference, and prediction. A recent construct of regulated growth hormone (GH) secretion interlinks the actions of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin (SRIF), and GH secretagogues (GHS) with GH feedback in the rat (Farhy LS, Veldhuis JD. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 288: R1649-R1663, 2005). In contrast, no comparable formalism exists to explicate GH dynamics in any other species. The present analyses explore whether a unifying model structure can represent species- and sex-defined distinctions in the human and rodent. The consensus principle that GHRH and GHS synergize in vivo but not in vitro was explicable by assuming that GHS 1) evokes GHRH release from the brain, 2) opposes inhibition by SRIF both in the hypothalamus and on the pituitary gland, and 3) stimulates pituitary GH release directly and additively with GHRH. The gender-selective principle that GH pulses are larger and more irregular in women than men was conferrable by way of 4) higher GHRH potency and 5) greater GHS efficacy. The overall construct predicts GHRH/GHS synergy in the human only in the presence of SRIF when the brain-pituitary nexus is intact, larger and more irregular GH pulses in women, and observed gender differences in feedback by GH and the single and paired actions of GHRH, GHS, and SRIF. The proposed model platform should enhance the framing and interpretation of novel clinical hypotheses and create a basis for interspecies generalization of GH-axis regulation.\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel-projected mechanistic bases for sex differences in growth hormone regulation in humans, Leon S.

Please note this particular version of the model is specific to females and also GHRH alone is being injected.  To simulate the injection of GHS and L-arginine the CellML model will have to be adapted slightly - this is relatively simple to do and will require changing a few initial conditions and parameters according to the description in the original paper. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Models of physiological systems facilitate rational experimental design, inference, and prediction. A recent construct of regulated growth hormone (GH) secretion interlinks the actions of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin (SRIF), and GH secretagogues (GHS) with GH feedback in the rat (Farhy LS, Veldhuis JD. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 288: R1649-R1663, 2005). In contrast, no comparable formalism exists to explicate GH dynamics in any other species. The present analyses explore whether a unifying model structure can represent species- and sex-defined distinctions in the human and rodent. The consensus principle that GHRH and GHS synergize in vivo but not in vitro was explicable by assuming that GHS 1) evokes GHRH release from the brain, 2) opposes inhibition by SRIF both in the hypothalamus and on the pituitary gland, and 3) stimulates pituitary GH release directly and additively with GHRH. The gender-selective principle that GH pulses are larger and more irregular in women than men was conferrable by way of 4) higher GHRH potency and 5) greater GHS efficacy. The overall construct predicts GHRH/GHS synergy in the human only in the presence of SRIF when the brain-pituitary nexus is intact, larger and more irregular GH pulses in women, and observed gender differences in feedback by GH and the single and paired actions of GHRH, GHS, and SRIF. The proposed model platform should enhance the framing and interpretation of novel clinical hypotheses and create a basis for interspecies generalization of GH-axis regulation.\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel-projected mechanistic bases for sex differences in growth hormone regulation in humans, Leon S.

Please note that the CellML model has been updated since the 2009 publication accccording the the first author's changes. \n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Spontaneously rhythmic pacemaker activity produced by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) is the result of the entrainment of unitary potential depolarizations generated at intracellular sites termed pacemaker units. In this study, we present a mathematical modeling framework that quantitatively represents the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics from a single ICC operating over the physiological membrane potential range. The mathematical model presented here extends our recently developed biophysically based pacemaker unit modeling framework by including mechanisms necessary for coordinating unitary potential events, such as a T-Type Ca2+ current, Vm-dependent K+ currents, and global Ca2+ diffusion. Model simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic slow wave depolarizations with an amplitude of 65 mV at a frequency of 17.4 cpm. Our model predicts that activity at the spatial scale of the pacemaker unit is fundamental for ICC slow wave generation, and Ca2+ influx from activation of the T-Type Ca2+ current is required for unitary potential entrainment. These results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ levels, particularly in the region local to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, significantly influence pacing frequency and synchronization of pacemaker unit discharge. Moreover, numerical investigations show that our ICC model is capable of qualitatively replicating a wide range of experimental observations.\n\n\nIn the study described here, Richard Faville et al. have developed a mathematical model of the ICC pacemaker potential.  The model can be divided into two distinct components: the bulk cytoplasm and the pacemaker units.  The later have been described previously (Faville et al., 2008, and the CellML description of this model can be found here).  The pacemaker unit model quantitatively describes the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics from a single ICC pacemaker unit, and a schematic diagram of this model can be seen in the figure immediately below.\n\n\nThe combined model is described here in CellML 1.1.  The pacemaker unit is defined and is imported into the bulk cytoplasm 10 times (note that the number of pacemaker units that could be used within the modelling framework is completely arbitrary, however 10 appears to be the minimum number required to adequately describe the pacemaker potential depolarisation).  In order to embed the pacemaker model within the bulk cytoplasm modelling framework the original pacemaker model had to be modified slightly.  This is because the it was only representative of pacemaker activity near the resting membrane potential of -70mV.  In its modified form and embedded within the bulk cytoplasm it is now capable of simulating pacemaker activity under conditions of membrane depolarisation (Vm > -60mV).  A full schematic diagram of the combined model is illustrated in the figure below. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nBiophysically based mathematical modeling of interstitial cells of Cajal slow wave activity generated from a discrete unitary potential basis, R.A.

This model quantitatively formalizes the framework of a novel ICC pacemaking mechanism that has recently been proposed. Model simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic UP depolarizations with an amplitude of approximately 3 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. The model predicts that the main inward currents, carried by a Ca(2+)-inhibited nonselective cation conductance, are activated by depletion of sub-plasma-membrane [Ca(2+)] caused by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration. Furthermore, pacemaker activity predicted by our model persists under simulated voltage clamp and is independent of [IP(3)] oscillations.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR to reproduce the published results. This particular version of the CellML model has had a stimulus protocol added to allow it to simulate trains of action potentials. The parameter values used in this variant (BR) of the Fenton-Karma model are consistent with the original Beeler-Reuter model (see Table 1 of the 1998 model errata).  Simulations of this CellML model can be run using CMISS.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Wave propagation in ventricular muscle is rendered highly anisotropic by the intramural rotation of the fiber. This rotational anisotropy is especially important because it can produce a twist of electrical vortices, which measures the rate of rotation (in degree/mm) of activation wavefronts in successive planes perpendicular to a line of phase singularity, or filament. This twist can then significantly alter the dynamics of the filament. This paper explores this dynamics via numerical simulation. After a review of the literature, we present modeling tools that include: (i) a simplified ionic model with three membrane currents that approximates well the restitution properties and spiral wave behavior of more complex ionic models of cardiac action potential (Beeler-Reuter and others), and (ii) a semi-implicit algorithm for the fast solution of monodomain cable equations with rotational anisotropy. We then discuss selected results of a simulation study of vortex dynamics in a parallelepipedal slab of ventricular muscle of varying wall thickness (S) and fiber rotation rate (theta(z)). The main finding is that rotational anisotropy generates a sufficiently large twist to destabilize a single transmural filament and cause a transition to a wave turbulent state characterized by a high density of chaotically moving filaments. This instability is manifested by the propagation of localized disturbances along the filament and has no previously known analog in isotropic excitable media. These disturbances correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of filament, or \"twistons,\" that create vortex rings when colliding with the natural boundaries of the ventricle. Moreover, when sufficiently twisted, these rings expand and create additional filaments by further colliding with boundaries. This instability mechanism is distinct from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave breakup that is not observed here during the initial instability. For modified Beeler-Reuter-like kinetics with stable reentry in two dimensions, decay into turbulence occurs in the left ventricle in about one second above a critical wall thickness in the range of 4-6 mm that matches experiment. However this decay is suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability. Specific experiments to test these results, and a method to characterize the filament density during fibrillation are discussed. Results are contrasted with other mechanisms of fibrillation and future prospects are summarized.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n         Vortex dynamics in three-dimensional continuous myocardium with fiber rotation: Filament instability and fibrillation, Flavio Fenton and Alain Karma, 1998, Chaos, 8, 20-47.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model is known to run in OpenCell and COR to reproduce the published results. Units have been checked. COR reports they are balanced and consistent while OpenCell is reporting some inconsistencies. OpenCell is currently having unit \"issues\" and we believe the units are correct in this CellML model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Action potential repolarization in the mammalian heart is governed by interactions of a number of time- and voltage-dependent channel-mediated currents, as well as contributions from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the Na+/K+ pump. Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents (HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+ currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle. Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two K+ currents, IK1 and HERG (or IK,r), within the framework of ten Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear K+ conductances, IK1 and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human ventricular tissue and/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s) of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle. Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the human electrocardiogram.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nContributions of HERG K+ current to repolarization of the human ventricular action potential, Martin Fink, Denis Noble, Laszlo Virag, Andras Varro, and Wayne R.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n      This model is a lumped parameter ODE model produced by taking the original PDE model and stripping out all spatial variation; this gives a spatially homogeneous model which doesn't take into account diffusion.\n    \n\n      This model validates with the validation service from the CellML API with no errors or warnings, and has been successfully simulated with the CellML Integration Service using the IDA and CVODE Adams-Moulton order 1-12 integrators. Due to the change to a lumped parameter formulation, the results of this model are not expected to be comparable to the published paper, nor to any biological reality, and so the results have not been checked against any other source.\n    \nModel Structure\n\nIntracellular calcium dynamics are frequently the subject of theoretical mathematical models (De Young and Keizer, 1992, Li and Rinzel, 1994, Keizer and Levine, 1996, Jafri-Rice-Winslow, 1998, and Snyder et al., 2000 are just a few examples of calcium dynamic models that have been coded up into CellML).  The physical and chemical laws of calcium waves and oscillations can be expressed in terms of differential equations describing reaction kinetics, fluxes through membranes, and diffusion.  \n\n \nIn this study, Charles C. Fink et al. produce an image-based model of a intracellular calcium wave in differentiated neuroblastoma cells (see \n    the figure\n   below).  One important conclusion from their analysis is that neuronal morphology plays a key role in controlling and shaping the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) dynamics that underlie the calcium wave.  The model is comprised of several components including: \n\n\nIP3 dynamics\n  -\n which account for IP3 synthesis at the plasma membrane, diffusion into the cytosol, and its degradation.\n\nCalcium dynamics\n  -\n which calculate the changing intracellular calcium concentration.\n\nChannel kinetics\n  -\n to describe calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol through an IP3-sensitive channel.\n\nSERCA pump kinetics\n  -\n to describe calcium uptake into the ER via the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps.\n\nLeak\n  -\n which models calcium leak from the ER to the cytosol.\n\nCalcium buffering\n  -\n with endogenous buffers.\n   \nTheir model is based on experimental data.  The binding of bradykinin (BK) to its receptor initiates a G-protein cascade, activation of phospholipase C, and degradation of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to IP3.  IP3 then diffuses through the cytosol from the plasma membrane to the ER where it activates Ca2+ release through the IP3R channel.  The concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ rises, and is subsequently reduced as Ca2+ binds to calcium buffers and is pumped back into the ER through the SERCA.  This Ca2+ wave was captured by Fink et al. through the use of fluorescent microscopy.  The model of this process was assembled using the Virtual Cell, a computational system for integrating experimentally recorded image, biochemical and electrophysiological data.  The model was tested by comparing several simulation results with the real experimental data, and Fink et al. found that there was good spatiotemporal agreement between the two data sets.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n \nIt should be noted that the following CellML description (for the raw CellML description of the model, see  below) is not quite true to the mathematical model published in the original paper (referenced below).  Currently CellML is unable to handle spatial elements, but this will hopefully be possible in the near future with the development of FieldML, an XML based language for spatially variable models.  This is important, as the relative positions of the cellular components such as receptors, pumps, channels and enzymes will determine the length of diffusion pathways and therefore the rate of reactions.\n\n\nAn Image-Based Model of Calcium Waves in Differentiated Neuroblastoma Cells, Charles C.

RIT uses a radioactive material attached to specially designed antibodies to locate cancer within the body.  Antibodies are defense proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system in order to fight infections caused by bacteria and other foreign pathogens.  The antibodies used in RIT are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which are developed in the laboratory in order to recognise marker molecules on the surface of tumor cells.  These antibodies are then modified to bind the radioactive metal Yttrium-90, which delivers high levels of local radiation to the tumour and subsequently destroys it.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of RIT is known to depend on at least six factors, including:\n\nthe totla absorbed dose and pattern of delivery;\nradiosensitivity;\nrate of repair of sublethal damage;\nongoing cancer proliferation during treatment;\ntumour heterogeneity; and\ntumour size.\n\nTherefore no single parameter is a good indicator of how effective the RIT has been.  Instead, several factors have to be simulataneously considered in order to get a more accurate characterisation of the biological effect.\n\n\nThe aim of this study by Flynn et al. was to develop a mathematical model that would relate the absorbed dose and its pattern of delivery to tumour response by incorporating information on each of the six  influencing factors (see \n    the figure\n   below).

These output neurons translate the post-synaptic potentials into a pattern of impulses whose frequency is regulated by the synaptic current.  Voltage-clamp studies of retinal ganglion cells have suggested that there are at least five different ionic currents present, namely: INa\n; ICa\n; the non-activating, delayed rectifier IK\n; inactivating IK,A\n; and calcium-activated potassium currents IK,Ca\n.  In 1990, Fohlmeister et al. developed a mathematical model of ganglion cell impulse generation which was based on these five ionic currents.  The first four currents were modelled as being voltage-gated, while the fifth current, IK,Ca\n, is gated by [Ca2+]i.  The basic mathematical structure of the model is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley style of cellular modelling (see The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952 for more details).  \n\n2+\n\nThis 1990 model appeared to provide a reasonably accurate representation of both the impulse waveform and repetitive firing behaviour of ganglion cells in the tiger salamander retina.  Model simulations suggested that IK,Ca\n might play an important role in stabilising the cell (i.e. preventing spontaneous firing), and also in regulating the interspike period.  To improve their understanding of this mechanism, in 1997, Fohlmeister and Miller combined new whole-cell experimental data together with pharmacological information and computer modelling to provide an integrated view of the experimental results, analysis, and simulation (see \n    the figure\n   below for a schematic diagram of their model).  \n\n\nModel simulations suggested that ICa\n and IK,Ca\n do play an important role in controlling impulse frequency.  But although this single compartment model was regarded as being qualitatively accurate in simulating impulse frequency behaviour and its underlying mechanisms, model limitations arose due to a lack of morphological data.  This issue was addressed in a detailed, multicompartmental model of the ganglion cell, which was published in a companion paper.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nImpulse Encoding Mechanisms of Ganglion Cells in the Tiger Salamander Retina, J.

To address this problem, we developed a new ionic model using formulations of currents based on previous models and recent experimental data. Compared with existing models, the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was decreased at depolarized potentials, the maximum conductance and rectification of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) were increased, and I(Kr) activation kinetics were slowed. The slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) was increased in magnitude and activation shifted to less positive voltages, and the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) was modified to produce a smaller, more rapidly inactivating current. Finally, a simplified form of intracellular calcium dynamics was adopted. In this model, APD alternans occurred at cycle lengths = 150-210 ms, with a maximum alternans amplitude of 39 ms. APD alternans was suppressed by decreasing I(Ca) magnitude or calcium-induced inactivation and by increasing the magnitude of I(K1), I(Kr), or I(Ks). These results establish an ionic basis for APD alternans, which should facilitate the development of pharmacological approaches to eliminating alternans.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIonic mechanism of electrical alternans, Jeffrey J.

This increase is primarily due to the opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane in response to glucose.  Glucose metabolism leads to an increase in the cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio, which in turn causes the ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close.  The beta-cell membrane becomes depolarised, Ca2+ channels open, and Ca2+ enters the cell.  These events underlie the glucose-induced electrical activity, which in pancreatic islets, consists of Ca2+-dependent action potentials.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThere is an abundance of literature that describes beta-cell electrical activity and its relationship to [Ca2+]i.  Complex and cyclic spike-burst activity, and corresponding [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic islets and beta-cell clusters are induced in response to a rise in extracellular glucose concentration.  Intermediate glucose concentrations induce both fast and slow oscillations.  The authors of this current study: Fridlyand, Tamarina and Philipson, have previously studied slow and fast [Ca2+]i oscillations in islets in response to a variety of conditions.  However, the experimental results were complex, and precise understanding was limited by the large number of channels and pumps in the beta-cell plasma membrane that were simultaneously working.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nIn order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this behaviour, in this publication Fridlyand et al. have developed a mathematical model of the Ca2+ fluxes in pancreatic beta-cells.  Several other mathematical models of glucose-induced insulin secretion, with corresponding descriptions of glucose transport, metabolism and ion regulation, have been published.  These include:\n\n2+\n\nExtracellular and Intracellular Calcium Effects on Pancreatic Beta Cells, Chay, 1997;\n\nNa+/Ca2+ Exchange in Models for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, Gall and Susa, 1999; and\n+\n2+\n\nThe Phantom Burster Model for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, Bertram et al., 2000.\n\nHowever, most of these models are focused on describing one specific phenomenon. They only include a very limited set of channels and pumps, and therefore it is difficult to apply them to a another situation.  In addition, since their publication, new experimental data has become available, and these new findings should be included in a theoretical model.  For this reason Fridlyand et al. have developed the new mathematical model described here (see the raw CellML description of the Fridlyand et al. 2003 model in ).  They have adopted the more complex style of modelling that has previously been used successfully to describe the electrophysiology of cardiac myocytes and other cell types (for example in Human Atrial Cell Model, Nygren et al. 1998 and in Modelling Interval-Force Relations in Cardiac Muscle, Rice et al., 2000).    \n\nTheir new model includes a wider range of channels and pumps, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sequestration mechanisms (see \n    the figure\n   below).  Using this model they were able to simulate whole cell electrical activity and [Ca2+]i, free calcium in the ER ([Ca2+]ER), intracellular Na + ([Na+]i), cytosolic ATP ([ATP]i), and inositol triphosphate ([IP3]i) concentrations.  However, they acknowledge that this model does not consider metabolic processes or insulin secretion.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n +\n+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling of Ca2+ flux in pancreatic beta-cells: role of the plasma membrane and intracellular stores, Leonid E.

Here, we show how the Akt pathway, which is involved in cell growth, specifically transmits temporal information contained in upstream signals to downstream effectors. We modeled the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt pathway in PC12 cells on the basis of experimental results. We obtained counterintuitive results indicating that the sizes of the peak amplitudes of receptor and downstream effector phosphorylation were decoupled; weak, sustained EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, rather than strong, transient phosphorylation, strongly induced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, a molecule downstream of Akt. Using frequency response analysis, we found that a three-component Akt pathway exhibited the property of a low-pass filter and that this property could explain decoupling of the peak amplitudes of receptor phosphorylation and that of downstream effectors. Furthermore, we found that lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, converted strong, transient Akt phosphorylation into weak, sustained Akt phosphorylation, and, because of the low-pass filter characteristics of the Akt pathway, this led to stronger S6 phosphorylation than occurred in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, an EGFR inhibitor can potentially act as a downstream activator of some effectors.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDecoupling of receptor and downstream signals in the Akt pathway by its low-pass filter characteristics, Fujita KA, Toyoshima Y, Uda S, Ozaki Y, Kubota H, and Kuroda S, 2009, Science Signaling, 3, issue 132.

Control of the cell cycle is achieved by artificially expressing a protein that reversibly binds and inactivates any one of the CDC proteins. In the simplest case, such as the checkpoint-free situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, the frequency of CDC oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the rate of synthesis, the binding rate, or the equilibrium constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of cell division, where size-control checkpoints are included, we show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell. Because this control scheme is general and requires only the expression of a single protein, it provides a practical means for tuning the characteristics of the cell cycle in vivo.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nA theory for controlling cell cycle dynamics using a reversibly binding inhibitor, Timothy S.

This model reproduces the curves on Figure 3, page 1047, using the corresponding initial values and the parameters found in Table S2. The variable Str has been given a value of 1 in order to show oscillatory behavior but may be changed to 0 or 2.5 for low and high values. This file is known to run on COR 0.9 and OpenCell.\nModel Structure\nAt intermediate intensities, stress induces oscillations in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor Msn2 in budding yeast. Activation by stress results in a reversible translocation of Msn2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This translocation is negatively controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway through Msn2 phosphorylation. Here we show that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Msn2 is necessary and sufficient to promote the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor. Because the NLS is controlled by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, we use a computational model to investigate the possibility that the cAMP-PKA pathway could function as an oscillator driving the periodic shuttling of Msn2. The model indicates that sustained oscillations of cAMP can indeed occur in a range bounded by two critical values of stress intensity, owing to the negative feedback exerted by PKA on cAMP accumulation. We verify the predictions of the model in mutants by showing that suppressing this negative-feedback loop prevents the oscillatory shuttling but still promotes the stress-induced nuclear localization of Msn2. The physiological significance of Msn2 oscillations is discussed in the light of the frequency encoding of cellular rhythms.\nNucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the yeast transcription factor Msn2: evidence for periodic PKA activation, Garmendia-Torres C, Goldbeter A, Jacquet M Current Biology, 17, 1044-1049PubMed ID: 17570669\n",

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Cardiac multicellular modeling has traditionally focused on ventricular electromechanics. More recently, models of the atria have started to emerge, and there is much interest in addressing sinoatrial node structure and function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We implemented a variety of one-dimensional sinoatrial models consisting of descriptions of central, transitional, and peripheral sinoatrial node cells, as well as rabbit or human atrial cells. These one-dimensional models were implemented using CMISS on an SGI Origin 2000 supercomputer. Intercellular coupling parameters recorded in experimental studies on sinoatrial node and atrial cell-pairs under-represent the electrotonic interactions that any cardiomyocyte would have in a multidimensional setting. Unsurprisingly, cell-to-cell coupling had to be scaled-up (by a factor of 5) in order to obtain a stable leading pacemaker site in the sinoatrial node center. Further critical parameters include the gradual increase in intercellular coupling from sinoatrial node center to periphery, and the presence of electrotonic interaction with atrial cells. Interestingly, the electrotonic effect of the atrium on sinoatrial node periphery is best described as opposing depolarization, rather than necessarily hyperpolarizing, as often assumed. CONCLUSION: Multicellular one-dimensional models of sinoatrial node and atrium can provide useful insight into the origin and spread of normal cardiac excitation. They require larger than \"physiologic\" intercellular conductivities in order to make up for a lack of \"anatomical\" spatial scaling. Multicellular models for more in-depth quantitative studies will require more realistic anatomico-physiologic properties.\n\n\nNote: There is a second variable which varies between models; version.  If version=0 the CellML model behaves like the Zhang et al. 2000 model.  If version=1 the CellML model describes a 0D capable, or suitable for single cell modelling, and if version=2 the CellML model describes a 1D capable, or suitable for multicellular modelling.  By default the CellML model is setup to describe a central SAN cell (dCell=0) suitable for single cell modelling (version=1).\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below.\n\n\nOne-dimensional rabbit sinoatrial node models: benefits and limitations, A.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR. It was created from equations [1] to [46]. The model parameters were taken from the Parameters document. The units have been checked and they are consistent.  v_sw has been set to 0 in this particular model which means the model is de-coupled from the circadian clock.  The CellML model runs to replicate the first part of figure 7B.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nWe propose an integrated computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls the dynamics of the mammalian cell cycle. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D/Cdk4-6 in G(1), cyclin E/Cdk2 at the G(1)/S transition, cyclin A/Cdk2 in S and at the S/G(2) transition, and cyclin B/Cdk1 at the G(2)/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nTemporal self-organization of the cyclin/Cdk network\ndriving the mammalian cell cycle.

Unit formulation here is such that the equations are dimensionally consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nThis model is a Cellml version of the Glasgow team's award-winning entry into iGEM07. Details of their formulation and model output can be found here.  \n\n\nHere the Cellml aims to reproduce the original equations as faithfully as possible. As such, this is not described using 'standard parts' Cellml. At the time of writing, standard parts Cellml is under development.\n\n\nSome modularity considerations have been observed. The basic architecture of the model has been broken up into four main components. One for each 'device' or promoter-to-double terminator DNA segment, and one for each 'bioenvironment' centered on a specific reaction (TFS association in one case, PYO formation from PCA in another).  Degradation reactions are housed in the appropriate BioEnvironment component.\n\n\nThis Cellml formulation could be easily extended in at least two ways:\n(1)\tUse Cellml 1.1 functionality and place the separate components in different files via imports.\n(2)\tTease apart the Bioenvironment components into species-specific components. At the moment, there is no reason to do this but it would make the model more extensible.\n",

Increased glucose concentration also induces rhythmical electrical activity in beta cells.  This activity consists of the periodic plateaus and spikes of Ca2+-dependent action potentials, which enhance Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion.  Two KCa channels are present in beta cells: a voltage dependent, \"fast\", large conductance KCa, and a slowly activating and deactivating KCa current, Kslow.  Kslow is thought to be responsible for islet pacemaking.  \n\n2+\n2+\n\nExperimental data suggest that both cytosolic calcium and calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play an essential role in the activation of Kslow channels.  In their 2002 paper, P.B. Goforth, R. Bertram, F.A. Khan, M. Zhang, A. Sherman, and L.S. Satin develop two mathematical models to test this theory (see \n    the figure\n   below).  Their first minimal model lacks a separate subspace, and they found that this two component model (cytosol and ER) was insufficient to explain Ca2+-induced activation of Kslow channels.  However, their second model incorporated a localised pool of Ca2+ in a subspace located between the plasma membrane and the ER.  In this model, subspace [Ca2+] is positively correlated with changes in cytosolic [Ca2+], but with a gradient that reflects Ca2+ efflux from the ER.  The simulations from this model were consistent with experimental data. \n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCalcium-activated K+ Channels of Mouse Beta-cells are Controlled by Both Store and Cytoplasmic Ca2+: Experimental and Theoretical Studies, P.B.

No scale is mentioned in the paper, so time is scaled arbitrarily in seconds, and variables that might be represented in arbitrary units of mass or force (weight) have been left dimensionless as their normalisation has been mentioned in the paper. The units are consistent throughout. \nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: The resolution to lose weight by cognitive restraint of nutritional intake often leads to repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling or \"yo-yo dieting\".  A simple mathematical model for weight cycling is presented.  The model is based on a feedback of psychological nature by which a subject decides to reduce dietary intake once a threshold weight is exceeded.  The analysis of the model indicates that sustained oscillations in body weight occur in a parameter range bounded by critical values.  Only outside this range can body weight reach a stable steay state.  The model provides a theoretical framework that captures key facets of weight cycling and suggests ways to control the phenomenon.  The view that weight cycling represents self-sustained oscillations has indeed specific implications.  In dymamical terms, to bring weight cycling to an end, parameter values should change in such a way as to induced the transition of body weight from sustained oscillations around an unstable steady state to a stable steady state.  Maintaining weight under a critical value should prevent weight cycling and allow body weight to stabilise below the oscillatory range.\nA model for the dynamics of human weight cycling, Albert Goldbeter, 2006, Journal of Biosciences, 31, 129-136.

The model also runs in COR but doe to the long duration of the simulation (100 minutes) COR is not reall suitable for such a simulation.

The model, built on recent experimental advances, is based on the cascade of post-translational modification that modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle. The model pertains to the situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, where the accumulation of cyclin suffices to trigger the onset of mitosis. In the first cycle of the bicyclic cascade model, cyclin promotes the activation of cdc2 kinase through reversible dephosphorylation, and in the second cycle, cdc2 kinase activates a cyclin protease by reversible phosphorylation. That cyclin activates cdc2 kinase while the kinase triggers the degradation of cyclin has suggested that oscillations may originate from such a negative feedback loop [Felix, M. A., Labbe, J. C., Doree, M., Hunt, T. and Karsenti, E. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 379-382]. This conjecture is corroborated by the model, which indicates that sustained oscillations of the limit cycle type can arise in the cascade, provided that a threshold exists in the activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin and in the activation of cyclin proteolysis by cdc2 kinase. The analysis shows how miototic oscillations may readily arise from time lags associated with these thresholds and from the delayed negative feedback provided by cdc2-induced cyclin degradation. A mechanism for the origin of the thresholds is proposed in terms of the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity previously described for biochemical systems regulated by covalent modification.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n          A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase, Albert Goldbeter, 1991, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 88, 9107-9111.

Taking into account recent experimental observations, the model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and on the negative feedback exerted by PER on the transcription of the period (per) gene. This minimal biochemical model provides a molecular basis for circadian oscillations of the limit cycle type. During oscillations, the peak in per mRNA precedes by several hours the peak in total PER protein. The results support the view that multiple PER phosphorylation introduces times delays which strengthen the capability of negative feedback to produce oscillations. The analysis shows that the rhythm only occurs in a range bounded by two critical values of the maximum rate of PER degradation. A similar result is obtained with respect to the rate of PER transport into the nucleus. The results suggest a tentative explanation for the altered period of per mutants, in terms of variations in the rate of PER degradation.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Model for Circadian Oscillations in the Drosophila Period Protein (PER), Albert Goldbeter, 1995, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences, 261, 319-324.

The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation.  This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store.  The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3.  In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. & Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Matl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variable, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations.  Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3.  The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. & Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.  We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behaviour and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation.

Using mathematical modeling, we show that mutually inhibitory gradients can generate and position sharp morphogen thresholds in the embryonic space. Taking vertebrate segmentation as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid (RA) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) along the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) may lead to the coexistence of two stable steady states. Here, we propose that this bistability is associated with abrupt switches in the levels of FGF and RA signaling, which permit the synchronized activation of segmentation genes, such as mesp2, in successive cohorts of PSM cells in response to the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Bistability resulting from mutual inhibition of RA and FGF provides a molecular mechanism for the all-or-none transitions assumed in the \"clock and wavefront\" somitogenesis model. Given that mutually antagonistic signaling gradients are common in development, such bistable switches could represent an important principle underlying embryonic patterning.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSharp developmental thresholds defined through bistability by antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid and FGF signaling.

In this particular version of the model couples the Notch, Wnt and FGF signalling pathways together and so uses equations A17 and A18 in the appendix to replace equations A4 and A10 respectively.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The formation of somites in the course of vertebrate segmentation is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock, which is characterized by a period ranging from 30 min to a few hours depending on the organism. This oscillator permits the synchronized activation of segmentation genes in successive cohorts of cells in the presomitic mesoderm in response to a periodic signal emitted by the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Recent microarray experiments [Dequeant, M.L., Glynn, E., Gaudenz, K., Wahl, M., Chen, J., Mushegian, A., Pourquie, O., 2006. A complex oscillating network of signaling genes underlies the mouse segmentation clock. Science 314, 1595-1598] indicate that the Notch, Wnt and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways are involved in the mechanism of the segmentation clock. By means of computational modeling, we investigate the conditions in which sustained oscillations occur in these three signaling pathways. First we show that negative feedback mediated by the Lunatic Fringe protein on intracellular Notch activation can give rise to periodic behavior in the Notch pathway. We then show that negative feedback exerted by Axin2 on the degradation of beta-catenin through formation of the Axin2 destruction complex can produce oscillations in the Wnt pathway. Likewise, negative feedback on FGF signaling mediated by the phosphatase product of the gene MKP3/Dusp6 can produce oscillatory gene expression in the FGF pathway. Coupling the Wnt, Notch and FGF oscillators through common intermediates can lead to synchronized oscillations in the three signaling pathways or to complex periodic behavior, depending on the relative periods of oscillations in the three pathways. The phase relationships between cycling genes in the three pathways depend on the nature of the coupling between the pathways and on their relative autonomous periods. The model provides a framework for analyzing the dynamics of the segmentation clock in terms of a network of oscillating modules involving the Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n         Modeling the segmentation clock as a network of coupled oscillations in the Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways, Albert Goldbeter and Olivier Pourquie, 2008, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 252, 574-585.

Please note this CellML translation was based on a an online version of the original paper - a version which contains more defined parameter values than the paper linked to from PubMed (the more detailed description).  Also there is a typo in this description in the ACTH Module. There should be a minus sign rather than a plus sign infront of  (k4*[CRH]+k5) (We thank the original model author for highlighting this). The correct equation is as follows: d[ACTH]/dt = k4*[CRH]+k5 - k6*[ACTH]- (k4*[CRH]+k5)*Imax*[cortisol]/(Kd+[cortisol]). Unfortunately there are no published figures of the results of the original model so we cannot confirm the CellML translation recreates the original published results.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: This paper describes the construction of a computer model that simulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) regulation of cortisol production. It is presented to illustrate the process of physiological modeling using standard \"off the shelf\" technologies. The model simulates components of the HPA axis involved in the continuous secretion and elimination of cortisol, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The physiological relations of these component pieces were modeled based on the current knowledge of their functioning. Rate constants, half lives, and receptor affinities were assigned values derived from the experimental literature. At its current level of development the model is able to accurately simulate the timing, magnitude and decay of the ACTH and cortisol concentration peaks resulting from the ovine-CRH stimulation test in normal and hypercortisolemic patients. The model will be used to predict the effects of lesions in different components of the HPA axis on the time course of cortisol and ACTH levels. We plan to use the model to explore the experimental conditions required to distinguish mechanisms underlying various disorders of the HPA axis, particularly depression. Efforts are currently underway to validate the model for a large variety of normal and pathological perturbations of the HPA axis.\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computer simulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, J.

The phenomena of feedback inhibition and feedback repression, whereby enzymatic activities are controlled at the level of the enzyme and the gene, respectively, provide a firm experimental basis for the construction of dynamic models which represent the fundamental regulatory activity of cells. The behavior of these and other molecular control circuits thus constitutes the basis of cell physiology, and in effect provides the physiologist with his elementary units of function. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the type of periodic behavior which can arise in model systems incorporating the essential control features of enzymatic regulatory processes, and to discuss the significance of oscillatory motion in relation to the organization of cellular processes in time.  \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n          Oscillatory behavior in enzymatic control processes, Brian C.

This model describes the metabolism of both L-dopa and benserazide. This model was created using the paper equations supplemented by suggestions made by Dr. Holford, as the original code was not available.   \n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nPURPOSE: To study the PK interaction of L-dopa/benserazide in rats. METHODS: Male rats received a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg L-dopa or 20 mg/kg benserazide or 80/20 mg/kg L-dopa/benserazide. Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes. In the model Ro 04-5127 inhibited competitively the L-dopa clearance by AADC. RESULTS: The coadministration of L-dopa/benserazide resulted in a major increase in systemic exposure to L-dopa and 3-OMD and a decrease in L-dopa clearance. The compartmental model allowed an adequate description of the observed L-dopa and 3-OMD concentrations in the absence and presence of benserazide. It had an advantage over noncompartmental analysis because it could describe the temporal change of inhibition and recovery of AADC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first investigation where the kinetics of benserazide and Ro 04-5127 have been described by a compartmental model. The L-dopa/benserazide model allowed a mechanism-based view of the L-dopa/benserazide interaction and supports the hypothesis that Ro 04-5127 is the primary active metabolite of benserazide.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA pharmacokinetic model to predict the PK interaction of L-dopa and benserazide in rats, Susan Grange, Nicholas H.

Most believe that this is due to the drug's ability to act as an efficient blockade of the de novo infection of target cells.  However, HAART is not 100 percent effective, usually because some long-lived infected cells persist, which then convert to short-lived HIV producers when activated.  The extent to which virus production from infected to uninfected cells is blocked is of great importance.  The answer will help to determine whether or not HAART is capable of eradicating HIV infection.\n\n\nThe concept that drug treatment is an efficient blockade of viral replication has derived much of its credibility from being incorporated into a model that successfully fits the kinetic data.  This model of HIV dynamics was published by Perelson et al. in 1996.  Their main observation was that viral load decline following drug application occurred in two discrete phases: an initial rapid decline (phase I) followed by a more gradual decline (phase II).  They explained this observation by the fact that the drugs decreased viral load by inhibiting the de novo infection of susceptible cells.  Phase I reflected the decline of the originally infected cells, and phase II reflected the decline of those infected cells which had a slightly longer half-life.\n\n\nHowever, the authors of the current model, Grossman et al. argue that the idea of a cell having a half-life is biologically implausible.  They suggest instead that it is more plausible to think of the infected lymphocytes undergoing an aging-like process.  That is, the death of an infected, HIV-producing cell follows productive infection after a time delay (see \n    the figure\n   below).  The observed exponential decline in viral load then requires an alternative explanation.  This is provided by assuming that de novo infection is not blocked completely by HAART, but only reduced.   \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nHIV infection: how effective is drug combination treatment?, Zvi Grossman, Mark Feinberg, Vladimir Kuznetsov, Dimiter Dimitrov, and William Paul, 1998, \nImmunology Today\n, 19, 528-532.  (Full text (HTML) and PDF versions of the article are available on the Immunology Today website.)  PubMed ID: 9818549\n\n\nModel simulations revealed that the half-life of the infected cells can be calculated with reasonable accuracy from clinical data.  However, the remaining parameters can not be accurately predicted from the current model, more data is needed.     \n\n\nA variable delay from productive cell infection to cell death can be modelled by dividing the process into several sequential stages.  These stages may represent real stages in the infection process, or they may be regarded as a modelling convenience.  Another method of modelling a variable delay is to introduce a distribution of delay times around a fixed average.  This is the approach chosen by the authors of the current model.\n",

This CellML model runs in both COR and OpenCell.  The units have been checked and they are consistent.  The equations are based on the scaled set in the paper (9-12) and the concentrations of the hormones are therefore dimensionless. For this reason the CellML model doesn't quite recreate the graphs in figure 4 (where the hormones are assigned units of picomolar and nanomolar).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The body's primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. RESULTS: We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states (low and high) and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this model, low GR concentration represents the normal steady state, and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. Long, repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state cortisol, which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an alternative, low cortisol state. This model can be used to explore mechanisms underlying disorders of the HPA axis.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nInclusion of the glucocorticoid receptor in a hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis model reveals bistability, Shakti Gupta, Eric Aslakson, Brian M.

The CellML code in these modules is based on the \nC code from the programme C-MODSIM created by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.\n\n\nThis particular CellML model describes the autonomic control of the circulation, which primarily operates through \nthe sympathetic system, though also to a slight extent through parasympathetic signals to the heart. These have been \nlumped together, and there are basically three separate feedback mechanisms in this computational block.  \nThese are:  (1)  feedback from the baroreceptor control system; (2) feedback from the peripheral chemoreceptors in \nthe carotid and aortic bodies,; and (3) feedback control of the circulatory system caused by central nervous system \nischemia, that is, ischemia of the vasomotor center of the brainstem.  Several other inputs that affect the autonomic \nnervous system are also included.  These are: activation of the autonomic nervous system during exercise; baroreceptor \nfeedback effects from pulmonary artery pressure (PPA), left atrial pressure (PLA), and an effect of low blood PO2 (PO2ART).\n\n\nThere are several publications referring to the Guyton model.

Due to the differences between procedural code (in this case C-code) and \n\t\tdeclarative languages (CellML), some aspects of the original model were not able to be encapsulated by the CellML \n\t\tmodel (such as the damping of variables). This may effect the transient behaviour of the model, however the \n\t\tsteady-state behaviour would remain\tthe same. The equations in this file and the steady-state output from the \n\t\tmodel conform to the results from the MODSIM program.\n    \nModel Structure\n\nArthur Guyton (1919-2003) was an American physiologist who became famous for his 1950s experiments in which he studied the \nphysiology of cardiac output and its relationship with the peripheral circulation.  The results of these experiments \nchallenged the conventional wisdom that it was the heart itself that controlled cardiac output.  Instead Guyton demonstrated \nthat it was the need of the body tissues for oxygen which was the real regulator of cardiac output.  The \"Guyton Curves\" \ndescribe the relationship between right atrial pressures and cardiac output, and they form a foundation for understanding the \nphysiology of circulation. \n\n\nThe Guyton model of fluid, electrolyte, and circulatory regulation is an extensive mathematical model of human circulatory physiology, \ncapable of simulating a variety of experimental conditions, and contains a number of linked subsystems relating to circulation and \nits neuroendocrine control.\n\n\nThis is a CellML translation of the Guyton model of the regulation of the circulatory system.

The CellML code \nin these modules is based on the C code from the programme C-MODSIM created by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.\n\n\nThis particular CellML model describes the the movement of fluid and protein through the capillary membrane.  It also calculates the volumes of \nfluid in the free fluid space of the interstitium and in the gel fluid space.  It calculates the pressures in both of these fluids as well as \nthe so-called solid tissue pressure caused by the compression of solid elements against other portions of the interstitium.  In addition, the \nquantities of proteins and their concentrations in both the free fluid and the gel fluid are calculated.

The salt appetite is considered in this \nmodel to be related to the adequacy of body metabolism, as measured by the PO2 level in the non-muscle tissue cells (POT).  Also when \nthe concentration of angiotensin increases (ANM), this too increases salt intake.  For instance in circulatory shock, when the adequacy \nof metabolism falls, the person develops a salt appetite.  Due to a lack of information, no control function of salt concentration per \nse has been assumed, merely that when the body salt falls, circulatory effectiveness falls, angiotensin increases, and a salt appetite \ndevelops.  Regarding thirst, three separate factors are assumed to drive the thirst mechanism: first, the concentration of antidiuretic \nhormone, which in turn is driven by changes in electrolyte composition (as detailed in another model); second, the effect of \nangiotensin on thirst, and; thirdly, the effect of the salt appetite stimulation on thirst.\n\n\nThere are several publications referring to the Guyton model.

The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges (\"latch bridges\"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCross-bridge phosphorylation and regulation of latch state in smooth muscle, Hai CM, Murphy RA, 1988, American Journal of Physiology, 254, C99-C106.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.  The CellMl model represents the deterministic version of the follicular automaton model. Currently CellML cannot be used to describe stochastic variables.  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Human scalp hair consists of a set of about 10 to the 5 follicles which progress independently through developmental cycles. Each hair follicle successively goes through the anagen (A), catagen (C), telogen (T) and latency (L) phases that correspond, respectively, to growth, arrest and hair shedding before a new anagen phase is initiated. Long-term experimental observations in a group of ten male, alopecic and non-alopecic volunteers allowed determination of the characteristics of hair follicle cycles. On the basis of these observations, we previously proposed a follicular automaton model to simulate the dynamics of human hair cycles and the development of different patterns of alopecia [Halloy et al. (2000) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A.97, 8328-8333]. The automaton model is defined by a set of rules that govern the stochastic transitions of each follicle between the successive states A, T, L and the subsequent return to A. These transitions occur independently for each follicle, after time intervals given stochastically by a distribution characterized by a mean and a standard deviation. The follicular automaton model was shown to account both for the dynamical transitions observed in a single follicle, and for the behaviour of an ensemble of independently cycling follicles. Here, we extend these results and investigate additional properties of the model. We present a deterministic version of the follicular automaton. We show that numerical simulations of the stochastic version of the automaton yield steady-state level of follicles in the different phases which approach the levels predicted by the deterministic equations as the number of follicles progressively increases. Only the stochastic version can successfully reproduce the fluctuations of the fractions of follicles in each of the three phases, observed in small follicle populations. When the standard deviation is reduced or when the follicles become otherwise synchronized, e.g. by a periodic external signal inducing the transition of anagen follicles into telogen phase, large-amplitude oscillations occur in the fractions of follicles in the three phases. These oscillations are not observed in humans but are reminiscent of the phenomenon of moulting observed in a number of mammalian species.

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computational model on the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways in heregulin-induced ErbB signalling, Mariko Hatakeyama, Shuhei Kimura, Takashi Naka, Takuji Kawasaki, Noriko Yumoto, Mio Ichikawa, Jae-Hoon Kim, Kazuki Saito, Mihoro Saeki, Mikako Shirouzu, Shigeyuki Yokoyama, and Akihiko Konagaya, 2003, The Biochemical Journal, 373, 451-463.

At the protein level, several molecules play a role in the control of the G1-S transition of the cell cycle.  Specifically, G1 cyclins such as cyclin E are known to form phosphorylated complexes with cyclin dependent kinases (cdk's, such as cdk2).  These complexes, which can be inhibited by other proteins, can phosphorylate pocket proteins such as pRb.  Hyperphosphorylation of pRb occurs at the time of E2F-1 release.  This transcription factor initiates the transcription of genes involved in S phase activities, including DNA polymerase. \n\nHatzimanikatis, Lee and Bailey capture the components and interactions of cyclin E, cdk2, pRb, inhibitor and E2F-1 during the G1-S transition of the cell cycle in their mathematical model (see the figure below).    \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Description of Regulation of the G1-S Transition of the Mammalian Cell Cycle, V.

Structurally and functionally, the interactions of hGH with its receptor have been resolved in fine detail, such that hGH and hGH receptor variants can be practically engineered by either random or rational approaches to achieve significant changes in the free energies of binding. A somewhat unique feature of hGH action is its homodimerization of two hGH receptors, which is required for intracellular signaling and stimulation of cell proliferation, yet the potencies of hGH mutants in cell-based assays rarely correlate with their overall receptor-binding avidities. Here, a mathematical model of hGH-stimulated cell signaling is posed, accounting not only for binding interactions at the cell surface but induction of receptor endocytosis and downregulation as well. Receptor internalization affects ligand potency by imposing a limit on the lifetime of an active receptor complex, irrespective of ligand-receptor binding properties. The model thus explains, in quantitative terms, the numerous published observations regarding hGH receptor agonism and antagonism and challenges the interpretations of previous studies that have not considered receptor trafficking as a central regulatory mechanism in hGH signaling.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical model of human growth hormone (hGH)-stimulated cell proliferation explains the efficacy of hGH variants as receptor agonists or antagonists, Jason M.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        The CellML model presented here represents the first \"core\" model from the published paper which describes the basic dynamics of GnRH-receptor binding in the pituitary and the subsequent release of LH. The model includes two different possible mechanisms to account for the observed disruption of the GnRH-LH relationship in the presence of continuous GnRH exposure: 1) a desensitised receptor, and 2) a limited, yet replenishable, pool of releasable LH. The CellML model runs in COR and OpenCell to replicate the published results. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We model the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the ovine pituitary. GnRH, released by the hypothalamus, stimulates the secretion of LH from the pituitary. If stimulus pulses are regular, LH response will follow a similar pattern. However, during application of GnRH at high frequencies or concentrations or with continuous application, the pituitary delivers a decreased release of LH (termed desensitization). The proposed mathematical model consists of a system of nonlinear differential equations and incorporates two possible mechanisms to account for this observed behavior: desensitized receptor and limited, available LH. Desensitization was provoked experimentally in vitro by using ovine pituitary cells in a perifusion system. The model was fit to resulting experimental data by using maximum-likelihood estimation. Consideration of smaller models revealed that the desensitized receptor is significant. Limited, available LH was significant in three of four chambers. Throughout, the proposed model was in excellent agreement with experimental data.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of luteinizing hormone release from ovine pituitary cells in perifusion, K.

The model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Model parameters are largely based on literature values. Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data. A case study is presented on how the model is intended to be used in the future to investigate the effects of post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComputational modeling of cardiovascular response to orthostatic stress, T.

There are additional problems with the model, but the presence of time delays rendered these superfluous. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nClinical studies of drug therapy in patients infected with HIV-1 or the hepatitis B virus provide the opportunity for estimating the kinetic constants of virus replication in vivo.  Treatment of HIV-1 with protease inhibitors results in the decline of free virus in several distinct phases:  Initially the plasma virus load remains virtually unchanged, then after this initial delay, the plasma load declines exponentially, due to the decreased virus synthesis in infected cells, and also due to the clearance of free virus particles.  Finally, the rate of virus decline decreases, and the viral load may even begin to increase again as the virus evolves a resistance to the protease inhibitor.\n\n\nThis publication by Herz et al. quickly followed an article by Perelson et al. (1996) in which they developed a mathematical model of HIV-1 dynamics in vivo based on their experimental data.  In this current publication, Herz et al. develop a new model that provides a description of HIV-1 dynamics, including the effects of an intracellular delay (the period between infection of a cell and the production of new virus particles).  This model accounts for the effects of a protease inhibitor on the rate of viral synthesis (see \n    the figure\n   below), and it has been encoded in CellML and can be downloaded in various formats in .    \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nLimitations on estimates of intracellular delay and virus decay, Andreas V.

The approach has been to use the simplest possible formulations of these mechanisms, which together with a minimum number of additional mechanisms allow reconstruction of action potentials, intracellular calcium transients and extracellular calcium transients. A 3:1 sodium-calcium exchange stoichiometry is assumed. Calcium-channel inactivation is assumed to take place by a voltage-dependent mechanism, which is accelerated by a rise in intracellular calcium; intracellular calcium release becomes a major physiological regulator of calcium influx via calcium channels. A calcium release mechanism is assumed, which is both calcium- and voltage-sensitive, and which undergoes prolonged inactivation. 200 microM cytosolic calcium buffer is assumed. For most simulations only instantaneous potassium conductances are simulated so as to study the other mechanisms independently of time- and calcium-dependent outward current. Thus, the model reconstructs extracellular calcium transients and typical action-potential configuration changes during steady-state and non-steady-state stimulation from the mechanisms directly involved in trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements. The model predicts relatively small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation (ca. 2 mumol kg-1 fresh mass per excitation); calcium current is fully activated within 2 ms of excitation, inactivation is substantially complete within 30 ms, and sodium-calcium exchange significantly resists repolarization from approximately -30 mV. Net calcium movements many times larger are possible during non-steady-state stimulation. Long action potentials at premature excitations or after inhibition of calcium release can be supported almost exclusively by calcium current (net calcium influx 5-30 mumol kg-1 fresh mass); action potentials during potentiated post-stimulatory contractions can be supported almost exclusively by sodium-calcium exchange (net calcium efflux 4-20 mumol kg-1 fresh mass). Large calcium movements between the extracellular space and the sarcoplasmic reticulum can take place through the cytosol with virtually no contractile activation. The simulations provide integrated explanations of electrical activity, contractile function and trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements, which were outside the explanatory range of previous models.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nExcitation-contraction coupling and extracellular calcium transients in rabbit atrium: reconstruction of the basic cellular mechanisms, Hilemann, D.W. and Noble, D. 1987,Proc.

These properties result from local control of Ca2+ release. Existing local control models of Ca2+ release in which interactions between L-Type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (RyRs) are simulated stochastically are able to reconstruct these properties, but only at high computational cost. Here we present a general analytical approach for deriving simplified models of local control of CICR, consisting of low-dimensional systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, from these more complex local control models in which LCC-RyR interactions are simulated stochastically. The resulting model, referred to as the coupled LCC-RyR gating model, successfully reproduces a range of experimental data, including L-Type Ca2+ current in response to voltage-clamp stimuli, inactivation of LCC current with and without Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, voltage-dependence of excitation-contraction coupling gain, graded release, and the force-frequency relationship. The model does so with low computational cost.\n\n\nThe original publication reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Simplified Local Control Model of Calcium-Induced Calcium Release in Cardiac Ventricular Myocytes, R.

In the more traditional genetic engineering approaches 'bottle-necks' are pinpointed using qualitative, intuitive approaches, but the alleviation of suspected 'rate-limiting' steps has not often been successful. Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http://jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself. Experiments confirmed the predictions of the model, i.e. knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and overexpressing NADH oxidase increased the flux through the acetolactate synthase branch from 0 to 75% of measured product formation rates.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMetabolic engineering of lactic acid bacteria, the combined approach: kinetic modelling, metabolic control and experimental analysis, Marcel H.N.

Thank you to the model author Jorrit Hornberg for providing us with the original mathematica code, and also to Joe Cursons for the hours he has spent debugging the CellMl model. Please note there are several differences between the original CellML version of this model (which was based on the published paper), and the current version of the model (which was based on the Mathematica code). These differences are listed here as a PDF document. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: \n\n\nABSTRACT: Oncogenesis results from changes in kinetics or in abundance of proteins in signal transduction networks. Recently, it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene expression.        \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nControl of MAPK signalling: from complexity to what really matters, Jorrit J Hornberg, Bernd Binder, Frank J Bruggeman, Birgit Schoeberl, Reinhart Heinrich and Hans V Westerhoff, 2005, Oncogene, 26, 117-125.

The parameter values for this model are different for different types of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. The parameter values used for this particular model were taken from Figure 2 on page 513 and reproduces the corresponding curves. Parameter values from pages 515 and 520 may be changed to reflect curves for Bursting, Chaos, Quasiperiodicity and Birhythmicity. The initial conditions have been set after allowing the model to run for approximately 5 minutes until steady state. This file is known to run in COR and OpenCell.\nModel Structure\nWe investigate the various types of complex Ca2+ oscillations which can arise in a model based on the mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), that takes into account the Ca2+-stimulated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) by a 3-kinase. This model was previously proposed in the course of an investigation of plausible mechanisms capable of generating complex Ca2+ oscillations. Besides simple periodic behavior, this model for cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in nonexcitable cells shows complex oscillatory phenomena like bursting or chaos. We show that the model also admits a coexistence between two stable regimes of sustained oscillations (birhythmicity). The occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior is analysed by means of bifurcation diagrams. Complex oscillations are characterized by means of Poincare sections, power spectra and Lyapounov exponents. The results point to the role of self-modulation of the InsP3 signal by 3-kinase as a possible source for complex temporal patterns in Ca2+ signaling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBursting, Chaos and Birhythmicity Originating from Self-modulation of the Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate Signal in a Model for Intracellular Ca2+ Oscillations, Houart G, Dupont G, Goldbeter A, 1999, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t, 61, 507-530 PubMed ID: 17883229\n",

Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nUltrasensitivity in the mitogen-activated protein cascade, Chi-Ying F.

A novel theoretical model of the canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca2+ transient (CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca2+-release formulation, Ca2+ subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L)) reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na). CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This positive rate-dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell function.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRate dependence and regulation of action potential and calcium transient in a canine cardiac ventricular cell model, Thomas J.

This CellML model translation is based on the curated SBML model in the BioModels database (BIOMD0000000061.xml). Note that in order to replicate figure 6 the model has to be run for at least 100 seconds first to allow all the oscillations to stabilise.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We present a powerful, general method of fitting a model of a biochemical pathway to experimental substrate concentrations and dynamical properties measured at a stationary state, when the mechanism is largely known but kinetic parameters are lacking. Rate constants and maximum velocities are calculated from the experimental data by simple algebra without integration of kinetic equations. Using this direct approach, we fit a comprehensive model of glycolysis and glycolytic oscillations in intact yeast cells to data measured on a suspension of living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae near a Hopf bifurcation, and to a large set of stationary concentrations and other data estimated from comparable batch experiments. The resulting model agrees with almost all experimentally known stationary concentrations and metabolic fluxes, with the frequency of oscillation and with the majority of other experimentally known kinetic and dynamical variables. The functional forms of the rate equations have not been optimized. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nFull-scale model of glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, F. Hynne, S.

However, responses to receptor activation cannot be easily ascribed to a uniform increase or decrease in cAMP activity throughout the entire cell. In this study, we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) and M(2) muscarinic receptor (M(2)R) activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane (caveolar and extracaveolar) microdomains and one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of beta(1)ARs and M(2)Rs, as well as the location of stimulatory (G(s)) and inhibitory (G(i)) G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited (AC5/6) and stimulated (AC4/7) by G(i), and multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4). Results obtained with the model indicate that: 1), bulk basal cAMP can be high ( approximately 1 microM) and only modestly stimulated by beta(1)AR activation ( approximately 2 microM), but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A ( approximately 100 nM to approximately 2 microM); 2), M(2)R activation strongly reduces the beta(1)AR-induced increases in caveolar cAMP, with less effect on bulk cAMP; and 3), during weak beta(1)AR stimulation, M(2)R activation not only reduces caveolar cAMP, but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of M(2)R activity.

This is achieved by mutation of the genes encoding the antibody, followed by selection for the B cells which express B cell receptors with the highest affinity for antigen.  Both gene mutation and subsequent protein selection occur in the germinal centres of secondary lymphoid organs.  Upon immunisation (infection), the antigen is concentrated in the secondary lymphoid organs, where a small subset of all B cells recognise it.  After successful presentation of the antigen fragments to T cells, B cells enter the blast state.  After about three days, the B blasts differentiate into centroblasts, and then into centrocytes.  Centrocytes express B cell receptors on their surface and they are believed to be subject to selection by antigen in that they need to bind, internalise and present antigen to T cells in order to prevent their under going apoptosis.  Centrocytes that successfully interact with T cells (selected centrocytes), can either differentiate into memory cells, antibody forming cells (AFCs), or they can revert back to the centroblast state (see \n    the figure\n   below). \n\n\nShortly after the first differentiation of centroblasts into centrocytes, somatic hypermutation starts to act on the centroblasts and changes the affinity of the B cell receptors for the antigen.  About 53% of the mutations are silent, and have no affect on affinity.  About 28% of the mutations are fatal, leading to B cell apoptosis.  The remaining 19% of mutations either increase or decrease affinity.  Selection is therefore needed to select for the mutations leading to an increase in affinity and driving affinity maturation.    \n\n\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not yet clearly understood, and as yet there is no experimental system available to investigate this.  A mathematical model is therefore useful in investigating hypotheses and comparing their simulation results with available experimental data.  In 2002, Iber and Maini published a mathematical model for germinal centre kinetics and affinity maturation.  They began with a simple model of the primed primary immune response (see \n    the figure\n   below), and then in this they embedded the model of affinity maturation.  Model simulations showed that antigen masking by antibodies can drive affinity maturation and provide a stabilising feedback mechanism.  Iber and Maini proposed that the selection probability of centrocytes and the recycling probability of selected centrocytes vary over time.  They also show that the efficiency of affinity maturation is highest if clones with a very high affinity antigen leave the germinal centre for either the memory or the plasma cell pool.  It is further shown that the termination of somatic hypermutation for several days before the end of the germinal centre immune reaction is beneficial for affinity maturation.   \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Model for Germinal Centre Kinetics and Affinity Maturation, Dagmar Iber and Philip K.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model will run in OpenCell but does not reproduce published results. This is the 20% Oxygen version, two more versions to follow.\n\nModel Structure\n\nOur small-scale bioreactor with a gas-permeable membrane has previously been shown to allow direct oxygenation of primary hepatocytes in \ncollagenous sandwich cultures. In this work the applicability of this system for studying the response of hepatocytes to different ambient oxygen \nconcentrations above the normoxic situation and the effect of the antioxidant vitamin C (ASC) on hepatocyte functionality in different oxygen \ncultures were evaluated. Determination of the parameters for functional levels (albumin and urea synthesis, biotransformation) combined with \nthe model calculation of these parameters using a product inhibition model based on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) indicated a \nrelevance of oxygen levels for the maintenance of hepatic-specific functions. A model for the dynamics of oxidative stress was proposed to predict the time course of the qualitative concentrations of H2 O2 and the superoxide radical (O2 \u2022 \u2212 ) in different oxygen cultures. The 20% and 30% O2 cultures exhibited similar differentiated hepatic functions that were unequivocally lost in the 40% O2 cultures apparently due to oxidative damage. Metabolic functions in the 20% and 30% O2 cultures could be improved by ASC. These findings suggest that our bioreactor model not only allows \na prediction of the liver response to variations in oxygen environments, but also serves as an in vitro tool to screen new compounds for antioxidant \ncapacity. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n'Improvement of metabolic performance of primary hepatocytes in \nhyperoxic cultures by vitamin C in a novel small-scale bioreactor, Stephanie Schmitmeier,  Angelika Langsch,  Wolfgang Schmidt-Heck,  \nInka Jasmund,  Augustinus Bader 2007 Journal of Membrane Science, 298, 30-40. \n",

This version of the CellML model represents the nodal-His (NH) cell.  The CellML model has been based on both the published paper and the original C++ code.\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Mathematical models are a repository of knowledge as well as research and teaching tools. Although action potential models have been developed for most regions of the heart, there is no model for the atrioventricular node (AVN). We have developed action potential models for single atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-His cells. The models have the same action potential shapes and refractoriness as observed in experiments. Using these models, together with models for the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrial muscle, we have developed a one-dimensional (1D) multicellular model including the SAN and AVN. The multicellular model has slow and fast pathways into the AVN and using it we have analyzed the rich behavior of the AVN. Under normal conditions, action potentials were initiated in the SAN center and then propagated through the atrium and AVN. The relationship between the AVN conduction time and the timing of a premature stimulus (conduction curve) is consistent with experimental data. After premature stimulation, atrioventricular nodal reentry could occur. After slow pathway ablation or block of the L-type Ca(2+) current, atrioventricular nodal reentry was abolished. During atrial fibrillation, the AVN limited the number of action potentials transmitted to the ventricle. In the absence of SAN pacemaking, the inferior nodal extension acted as the pacemaker. In conclusion, we have developed what we believe is the first detailed mathematical model of the AVN and it shows the typical physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the tissue. The model can be used as a tool to analyze the complex structure and behavior of the AVN.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nOne-dimensional mathematical model of the atrioventricular node including atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-his cells, S.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We hypothesize that slow inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and its modulatory effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ handling are important for various interval-force (I-F) relations, in particular for the beat interval dependency in transient alternans during the decay of post-extrasystolic potentiation. We have developed a mathematical model of a single cardiomyocyte to integrate various I-F relations, including alternans, by incorporating a conceptual CaMKII kinetics model into the SR Ca2+ handling model. Our model integrates I-F relations, such as the beat interval-dependent twitch force duration, restitution and potentiation, positive staircase phenomenon and alternans. We found that CaMKII affects more or less all I-F relations, and it is a key factor for integration of the various I-F relations in our model. Alternans arises, in the model, out of a steep relation between SR Ca2+ load and release, owing to SR load-dependent changes in the releasability of Ca2+ via the ryanodine receptor. Beat interval-dependent CaMKII activity, owing to its kinetic properties and amplifying effect on SR Ca2+ load dependency of Ca2+ release, replicated the beat interval dependency of alternans, as observed experimentally. Additionally, our model enabled reproduction of the effects of various interventions on alternans, such as the slowing or accelerating of Ca2+ release and/or uptake. We conclude that a slow time-dependent factor, represented in the model by CaMKII, is important for the integration of I-F relations, including alternans, and that our model offers a useful tool for further analysis of the roles of integrative Ca2+ handling in myocardial I-F relations.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nModulatory effect of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling and interval-force relations: a modelling study, Gentaro Iribe, Peter Kohl and Denis Noble, 2006,  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 364, (1842), 1107-1133.

This model is valid CellML and has consistent units\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress\nand is characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death. In this study, we simulated mutations in 2 genes\nlinked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, the first located in calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the\nsecond in the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanistic basis for spontaneous\nCa2 release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations in affected patients. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) luminal\nCa2 sensing was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular myocyte, and CSQN2 mutations were modeled\nby simulating disrupted RyR2 luminal Ca2 sensing. In voltage-clamp mode, the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated\nthe smaller calcium transients, smaller time to peak calcium transient, and accelerated recovery from inactivation seen\nin experiments. In current clamp mode, in the presence of stimulation, we observed delayed afterdepolarizations,\nsuggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2 sensing underlies the triggered activity\nobserved in mutant CSQN2-expressing myocytes. In current-clamp mode, in a model of mutant RyR2 that is\ncharacterized by reduced FKBP12.6 binding to the RyR2 on stimulation, the impaired coupled gating characteristic\nof these mutations was modeled by reducing cooperativity of RyR2 activation. In current-clamp mode, the mutant RyR2\nmodel exhibited increased diastolic RyR2 open probability that resulted in formation of delayed afterdepolarizations. In\nconclusion, these minimal order models of mutant CSQN2 and RyR2 provide plausible mechanisms by which defects\nin RyR2 gating may lead to the cellular triggers for arrhythmia, with implications for the development of\ntargeted therapy. \n\n\n   Mechanisms of Abnormal Calcium Homeostasis in Mutations Responsible for Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, Vivek Iyer, Roger J.

Models of each of the major ionic currents present in these cells are formulated and validated using experimental data obtained from studies of recombinant human ion channels and/or whole-cell recording from single myocytes isolated from human left-ventricular subepicardium. Continuous-time Markov chain models for the gating of the fast Na(+) current, transient outward current, rapid component of the delayed rectifier current, and the L-type calcium current are modified to represent human data at physiological temperature. A new model for the gating of the slow component of the delayed rectifier current is formulated and validated against experimental data. Properties of calcium handling and exchanger currents are altered to appropriately represent the dynamics of intracellular ion concentrations. The model is able to both reproduce and predict a wide range of behaviors observed experimentally including action potential morphology, ionic currents, intracellular calcium transients, frequency dependence of action-potential duration, Ca(2+)-frequency relations, and extrasystolic restitution/post-extrasystolic potentiation. The model therefore serves as a useful tool for investigating mechanisms of arrhythmia and consequences of drug-channel interactions in the human left-ventricular myocyte.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computational model of the human left-ventricular epicardial myocyte, Vivek Iyer, Reza Mazhari and Raimond L.

The contractile element has been modeled taking into account the results of extensive mechanical tests that involved the recording of length-force and force-velocity relations and muscle responses to short-time deformations during various phases of the contraction-relaxation cycle. The best agreement between the experimental and the mathematical modeling results was obtained when a postulate stating two types of cooperativity to regulate the calcium binding by troponin was introduced into the model. Cooperativity of the first type is due to the dependence of the affinity of troponin C for Ca2+ on the concentration of myosin crossbridges in the vicinity of a given troponin C. Cooperativity of the second type assumes an increase in the affinity of a given troponin C for Ca2+ when the latter is bound by molecules neighboring troponin. \n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCooperative Effects Due to Calcium Binding by Troponin and Their Consequences for Contraction and Relaxation of Cardiac Muscle Under Various Conditions of Mechanical Loading, Valery Ya.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n \nABSTRACT: We construct a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ regulation in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCardiac Calcium Dynamics: The Roles of Ryanodine Receptor Adaptation and Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Load, M.

The units are consistent throughout, but it does not reproduce the published results. It is a faithful reproduction of the paper equations (eqns 5-8), where all reaction constants are defined by equations, but the CellML model does not precisely reproduce the figures in the paper because to do this the reaction constants have to be defined explicitly (the parameter values are listed in the figure legends). Such CellML models have been created (called Fig4 and Fig5) and they exist in this workspace. \t \n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Mathematical modeling has proven to be valuable in understanding of the complex biological systems dynamics. In the present report we have developed an initial model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system self-regulatory activity. A four-dimensional non-linear differential equation model of the hormone secretion was formulated and used to analyze plasma cortisol levels in humans. The aim of this work was to explore in greater detail the role of this system in normal, homeostatic, conditions, since it is the first and unavoidable step in further understanding of the role of this complex neuroendocrine system in pathophysiological conditions. Neither the underlying mechanisms nor the physiological significance of this system are fully understood yet.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical modeling of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system activity, Smiljana Jelic, Zeljko Cupic, and Ljiljana Kolar-Anic, 2005, Mathematical Biosciences, 197, pp173-187.

It involves both the central and the enteric nervous systems (CNS and ENS respectively), in addition to a network of paracrine and endocrine cells.  The overall aim is to maintain stomach luminal pH within a narrow range such that food digestion is optimised. \n\n\nFour cell populations and their secretory products form the core acid secretory process in humans.  These four cell populations are gastrin (G)- and somatostatin (D)-secreting cells, endochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and parietal cells.  G and ECL cell products stimulate acid secretion (positive feedback) and D cells inhibit acid release (negative feedback).  Exactly how these feedback loops interact is species specific, however, the basic requirement for acid secretion is conserved amongst species.  Mathematical modelling provides a powerful tool for investigating the integrated system, and it is also immune to the inconsistencies of in vivo and in vitro experimental studies. \n\n\n\n\nIn the Joseph et al. 2003 publication described here, the authors use a novel mathematical model to describe the complex system of gastric acid regulation (see  and  below).  They use experimental data to validate their model simulations, and then go onto use the model to study conditions that are not yet experimentally reproducible.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model for integrative study of human gastric acid secretion, Ian M.P.

That model did not include viscous elements. Here we propose a modification of the model, in which two viscous elements are added, one in parallel to the contractile element, and one more in parallel to the series elastic element. The modified model allowed us to simulate and explain some subtle experimental data on relaxation velocity in isotonic twitches and on a mismatch between the time course of sarcomere shortening/lengthening and the time course of active force generation in isometric twitches. Model results were compared with experimental data obtained from 28 rat LV papillary muscles contracting and relaxing against various loads. Additional model analysis suggested contribution of viscosity to main inotropic and lusitropic characteristics of myocardium performance.   \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInfluence of viscosity on myocardium mechanical activity: a mathematical model, Leonid B.

In his 2001 paper (cited below), James Keener examines a mathematical model for in vitro insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in a one-dimensional chemical flow reactor, where the reaction region is represented by the volume occupied by the cells (see \n    the figure\n   below).  Glucose enters the cell through GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 transporters.  Once inside the cell, intracellular glucose is metabolised, and this process activates insulin secretion via exocytosis of insulin containing granules.  In the extracellular medium, insulin activates GLUT-1 transporters and inactivates GLUT-2 transporters.   \n\n\nIn order to model the reactions, a steady flow of solution along the one-dimensional reactor is assumed, with insulin cells confined to a one-dimensional region.  Keener found that the oscillations occur as a result of an important interplay between flow rate of the reactor and insulin diffusion.

The CellML model can replicate the shapes of the graphs of all of the figures in the paper but the scale does not always match those in the paper.\n          \nModel Structure\n ABSTRACT: We devise a mathematical model to study germinal center (GC) kinetics. Earlier models for GC kinetics are extended by explicitly modeling 1) the cell division history of centroblasts, 2) the Ag uptake by centrocytes, and 3) T cell dynamics. Allowing for T cell kinetics and T-B cell interactions, we study the role of GC T cells in GC kinetics, GC termination, and B cell selection. We find that GC T cells play a major role in GC formation, but that the maintenance of established GC reactions requires very few T cells only. The results therefore suggest that the termination of a GC reaction is largely caused by lack of Ag on the follicular dendritic cells and is hardly influenced by Th cells. Ag consumption by centrocytes is the major factor determining the decay rate of the antigenic stimulus during a GC reaction. Investigating the effect of the Ag dose on GC kinetics, we find that both the total size of the GC and its duration are hardly influenced by the initial amount of Ag. In the model this is due to a buffering effect by competition for limited T cell help and/or competition between proliferating centroblasts.   \n\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Model on Germinal Center Kinetics and Termination, Can Kesmir and Rob J.

However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nQuantification of Short Term Signaling by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, Boris N.

Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nQuantification of Short Term Signaling by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, Boris N.

This was suggested by the author to help with solving the problem, due to its very stiff nature. Some but not all output from the paper can be reproduced by this model. Values of s1 and s2 have been set to zero to represent a non-treatment situation. A value of 0.02 has been given to the variable c, which defines the antigenicity of the tumour, to represent the middle of the range given for this parameter. The model may be re-parameterised to give other relevant outputs, for example, if s1 is greater than 0 while s2 equals 0, the model can simulate adoptive cellular immunotherapy.  The model will not run in COR due to time being defined as dimensionless.\n          \nModel Structure\n\n\t\tABSTRACT: A number of lines of evidence suggest that immunotherapy with the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) may boost the immune system to fight tumors. CD4+ T cells, the cells that orchestrate the immune response, use these cytokines as signaling mechanisms for immune-response stimulation as well as lymphocyte stimulation, growth, and differentiation. Because tumor cells begin as 'self', the immune system may not respond in an effective way to eradicate them. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy can potentially restore or enhance these effects. We illustrate through mathematical modeling the dynamics between tumor cells, immune-effector cells, and IL-2. These efforts are able to explain both short tumor oscillations in tumor sizes as well as long-term tumor relapse. We then explore the effects of adoptive cellular immunotherapy on the model and describe under what circumstances the tumor can be eliminated.     \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling immunotherapy of the tumor-immune interaction, Denise Kirschner and John Carl Panetta, 1998,\n            Journal of Mathematical Biology, 37, 235-252.

AZT is an approved method of chemotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection.  The drug works as an inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of RNA to DNA during gene transcription.  HIV is an RNA virus.  The presence of AZT in a cell prevents the viral RNA from being transcribed into DNA, thus halting cellular infection and hence, viral spread.    \n\n\nUnfortunately AZT is not a cure for HIV, it only serves to control the virus and prevent its further progress.  This often has the effect of prolonging the life of a HIV positive patient, and sometimes, AZT treatment also makes them less infectious to their sexual partners.  There is debate as to what stage during the disease the drug should be administered (early or late?), and at what dose (high or low?).  Further problems concerning AIDS therapy involve the possibility of negative side effects and the evolution of viral resistance.   \n\n\nTo date, there have been several mathematical models published which describe the dynamics of HIV and different therapies.  These include:\n\n\nPerelson et al., Modelling HIV-1 Dynamics In Vivo, 1996\n\n\nMittler et al., Influence of Delayed Viral Production on Viral Dynamics in HIV-1 Infected Patients, 1998, and\n\nWodarz and Nowak, Modelling the Interaction Between HIV and the Immune System, 1999.\n\nIn the publication decribed here, Kirschner and Webb present a mathematical model which describes the interactions of chemotherapy with the HIV infected immune system, as shown in \n    the figure\n   below.  They define three populations:\n\n1) non-infected CD4+ (helper) T cells;\n+\n2) CD4+ T cells which are infected with HIV; and\n+\n3) the population of HIV that is free living in the blood.\n\nThe effects of AZT chemotherapy are also included in the model.  AZT reduces the ability of the virus to infect the CD4+ T cells.\n\n+\n\nThe 1996 Kirschner and Webb publication present two mathematical models.  In order to provide a mechanistic description of chemotherapy, age structure is incorporated into the infected CD4+ T cells in the second model.  Introducing a time scale allows the model to mimic the effects of several drug doses, administered over a defined time period (e.g. 24 hours).  The models have been described here in CellML, (the raw CellML descriptions of the Kirschner and Webb 1996 models can be downloaded in various formats as described in ).     \n\n+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Model for Treatment Strategy in the Chemotherapy of AIDS, Denise Kirschner and G.

These models include equations that describe transmembrane ion channels and pumps, as well as the intracellular calcium uptake and release activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and changing intracellular ionic concentrations.  Dynamic models are carefully constructed to accurately simulate the experimentally observed electrophysiological behaviour of cells.\n\n\nTime-dependent changes (transients) in ionic concentrations and action potentials are often observed in experiments.  In mathematical models, transients may represent artifacts of the equations or may reflect physiological processes.  In their 2002 paper, James Kneller, Rafael J. Ramirez, Denis Charter, Marc Courtemanche and Stanley Nattel studied electrophysiological transients in an ionic model of the canine atrial action potential.  Their aims were to determine whether dynamic models reach stability during sustained pacing, to investigate the ionic basis of action potential transients in the model, and to compare real physiological action potential transients with those generated by the model.  Their model was based on the previously published Ramirez-Nattel-Courtemanche (RNC) model of the canine action potential (see Ramirez et al. Canine Atrial Action Potential Model, 2000, also in the CellML model repository).  In this model, I\nCl,Ca brings Cl- into the cell, but there is no equation to account for Cl- efflux.  In their 2002 modified version of the RNC model, James Kneller, Rafael J. Ramirez, Denis Charter, Marc Courtemanche and Stanley Nattel include an inward, electroneutral Na+-Cl- cotransporter (I\nNa,Ca), and a constant Cl- efflux through a leakage pathway (I\nb,Cl) (see the figure below).\n\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n\nAfter comparing the results simulated by the model with experimental data, James Kneller, Rafael J.

This model only describes the standalone SERCA pump, and is based on the original matlab code dy_buffering_serca. Other versions of this model couple the SERCA pump to a reduced cardiac myocyte model.  \n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: When developing large-scale mathematical models of physiology, some reduction in complexity is necessarily required to maintain computational efficiency. A prime example of such an intricate cell is the cardiac myocyte. For the predictive power of the cardiomyocyte models, it is vital to accurately describe the calcium transport mechanisms, since they essentially link the electrical activation to contractility. The removal of calcium from the cytoplasm takes place mainly by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). In the present study, we review the properties of SERCA, its frequency-dependent and beta-adrenergic regulation, and the approaches of mathematical modelling that have been used to investigate its function. Furthermore, we present novel theoretical considerations that might prove useful for the elucidation of the role of SERCA in cardiac function, achieving a reduction in model complexity, but at the same time retaining the central aspects of its function. Our results indicate that to faithfully predict the physiological properties of SERCA, we should take into account the calcium-buffering effect and reversible function of the pump. This 'uncomplicated' modelling approach could be useful to other similar transport mechanisms as well.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModelling Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium APTase and its Regulation in Cardiac Myocytes, Jussi T.

PTH targets bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, to increase expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Intriguingly, whereas continuous administration of PTH decreases bone mass, intermittent PTH has an anabolic effect on bone, which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on osteoblastic bone formation. However, antiresorptive therapies impair the ability of PTH to increase bone mass, indicating a complex role for osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes the actions of PTH at a single site of bone remodeling, where osteoclasts and osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts. As a result, PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon application, followed by compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration resulted in net bone loss, because bone resorption preceded bone formation at all times. In contrast, over a wide range of model parameters, short application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone mass, because osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH withdrawal, enabling osteoblasts to rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental findings, increase in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone. This study presents an original concept for the regulation of bone remodeling by PTH, currently the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical model of paracrine interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts predicts anabolic action of parathyroid hormone on bone, Komarova SV, 2005, Endocrinology, 146, 3589-3595.

Disruptions in bone remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and Paget's disease. Interactions among cells of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages are critical in the regulation of bone remodeling. We constructed a mathematical model of autocrine and paracrine interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts that allowed us to calculate cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. The model predicted different modes of dynamic behavior: a single remodeling cycle in response to an external stimulus, a series of internally regulated cycles of bone remodeling, or unstable behavior similar to pathological bone remodeling in Paget's disease. Parametric analysis demonstrated that the mode of dynamic behavior in the system depends strongly on the regulation of osteoclasts by autocrine factors, such as transforming growth factor beta. Moreover, simulations demonstrated that nonlinear dynamics of the system may explain the differing effects of immunosuppressants on bone remodeling in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the mathematical model revealed that interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts result in complex, nonlinear system behavior, which cannot be deduced from studies of each cell type alone. The model will be useful in future studies assessing the impact of cytokines, growth factors, and potential therapies on the overall process of remodeling in normal bone and in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical model predicts a critical role for osteoclast autocrine regulation in the control of bone remodeling, Komarova SV, Smith RJ, Dixon SJ, Sims SM, Wahl LM, 2003, Bone, 33, 206-215.

However, the selective forces responsible for the emergence of genetic instability are not clear. We use mathematical models to determine the conditions under which selection favors instability, and when stable cells are advantageous. We take into account the processes of DNA damage, repair, cell cycle arrest, mutation, and death. We find that the rate of DNA damage can play a major role in this context. In particular, an increase in the rate of DNA damage can reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells. In terms of cancer progression, we find the following results. If cells have intact apoptotic responses, stable cells prevail if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can result in the selection of genetically unstable cells. This has implications for the induction of tumors by carcinogens. On the other hand, if cells are characterized by impaired apoptosis, we observe the opposite. Genetic instability is selected for if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can select against instability and result in the persistence of stable cells. We propose that chemotherapy can be used to reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells, such that unstable cells are the inferior competitors. This could result in the competitive exclusion of progressing cancer cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nEvolutionary dynamics of mutator phenotypes in cancer: implications for chemotherapy, Natalia L.

The figures in the original publication display slightly unusual variables, hence we are unsure as to whether or not the CellML model is recreating the published results.  To address this we are working with the original model authors to complete the curation of the CellML model.  Please also note there are some typographical errors in the original publication, and that in equations 6-10 in the appendix, the metabolites should have an \"i\" subscript(to denote IMS concentrations), and also the \"Vhyd\"s in these equations should be \"Vsyn\"s.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nATP is the major energy currency in cells. It is synthesised during aerobic respiration in the mitochondria and it's main use in muscle is in myofibrillar contraction an ion pumping. Phosphocreatine (PCr) is another major energy carrier in muscle cells, in fact the majority of the energy-carrying phosphate groups leave the mitochondria in the form of PCr, not ATP. This is possible due to the creatine kinase (CK) reaction, see Figure 1 below, where Cr is creatine:         \n\n\nThe mitochondrial isoform of the CK enzyme (MiCK) produces PCr, while the main myofibrillar isoform (MMCK) converts it back into ATP. This energy transfer is also referred to as the phosphocreatine shuttle, and it facilitates energy transfer by providing a parallel pathway to ATP diffusion. In muscle cells, the CK system also acts as an energy buffer, allowing ATP levels to remain fairly constant during muscle contraction as PCr levels fluctuate to closely follow force generation.\n\n\nIn the Kongas and van Beek 2001 publication described here, the authors aim to determine the mode of functioning of the CK system in the heart. To this end they devloped a mathematical model of energy production, transfer, and consumption (see Figure 2 below) and analysed the roles of different CK isoenzymes in the dynamic response to workload transitions.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCreatine kinase in energy metabolic signaling in muscle, Olav Kongas and Johannes H.

The previously published model of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria was extended by incorporation of the creatine kinase system (creatine kinase plus phosphocreatine/creatine pair), cytosolic proton production/consumption system (proton production/consumption by the creatine kinase-catalysed reaction, efflux/influx of protons), physiological size of the adenine nucleotide pool and some additional minor changes. Theoretical studies performed by means of the extended model demonstrated that the CK system, which allows for large changes in P(i) in relation to isolated mitochondria system, has no significant influence on the kinetic properties of oxidative phosphorylation, as inorganic phosphate only slightly modifies the relationship between the respiration rate and [ADP]. Computer simulations also suggested that the second-order dependence of oxidative phosphorylation on [ADP] proposed in the literature refers only to the ATP synthesis flux, but not to the oxygen consumption flux (the difference between these two fluxes being due to the proton leak). Next, time courses of changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations during transition between different steady-states were simulated. The model suggests, in accordance with previous theoretical predictions, that activation of oxidative phosphorylation by an increase in [ADP] can (roughly) explain the behaviour of the system only at low work intensities, while at higher work intensities parallel activation of different steps of oxidative phosphorylation is involved.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian skeletal muscle, Bernard Korzeniewski and Jerzy A.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        This CellML model runs in OpenCell to recreate the published results. The units have been checked and they are consistent. PTH is pulsed every 6 hours and the model needs to be run for some time before the oscillations stabilise. The CellML model will also run in COR but due to the time unit being hours it is not really suitable for full length simulations.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) paradoxically causes net bone loss (resorption) when administered in a continuous fashion, and net bone formation (deposition) when administered intermittently. Currently no pharmacological formulations are available to promote bone formation, as needed for the treatment of osteoporosis. The paradoxical behavior of PTH confuses endocrinologists, thus, a model bone resorption or deposition dependent on the timing of PTH administration would de-mystify this behavior and provide the basis for logical drug formulation. We developed a mathematical model that accounts for net bone loss with continuous PTH administration and net bone formation with intermittent PTH administration, based on the differential effects of PTH on the osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations of cells. Bone, being a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of PTH. The overall effect of PTH is to raise plasma levels of calcium, partly through bone resorption. Osteoclasts resorb bone and liberate calcium, but they lack receptors for PTH. The preosteoblastic precursors and preosteoblasts possess receptors for PTH, upon which the hormone induces differentiation from the precursor to preosteoblast and from the preosteoblast to the osteoblast. The osteoblasts generate IL-6; IL-6 stimulates preosteoclasts to differentiate into osteoclasts. We developed a mathematical model for the differentiation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations in bone, using a delay time of 1 hour for differentiation of preosteoblastic precursors into preosteoblasts and 2 hours for the differentiation of preosteoblasts into osteoblasts. The ratio of the number of osteoblasts to osteoclasts indicates the net effect of PTH on bone resorption and deposition; the timing of events producing the maximum ratio would induce net bone deposition. When PTH is pulsed with a frequency of every hour, the preosteoblastic population rises and decreases in nearly a symmetric pattern, with 3.9 peaks every 24 hours, and 4.0 peaks every 24 hours when PTH is administered every 6 hours. Thus, the preosteoblast and osteoblast frequency depends more on the nearly constant value of the PTH, rather than on the frequency of the PTH pulsations. Increasing the time delay gradually increases the mean value for the number of osteoblasts. The osteoblastic population oscillates for all intermittent administrations of PTH and even when the PTH infusion is constant. The maximum ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts occurs when PTH is administered in pulses of every 6 hours. The delay features in the model bear most of the responsibility for the occurrence of these oscillations, because without the delay and in the presence of constant PTH infusions, no oscillations occur. However, with a delay, under constant PTH infusions, the model generates oscillations. The osteoblast oscillations express limit cycle behavior. Phase plane analysis show simple and complex attractors. Subsequent to a disturbance in the number of osteoblasts, the osteoblasts quickly regain their oscillatory behavior and cycle back to the original attractor, typical of limit cycle behavior. Further, because the model was constructed with dissipative and nonlinear features, one would expect ensuing oscillations to show limit cycle behavior. The results from our model, increased bone deposition with intermittent PTH administration and increased bone resorption with constant PTH administration, conforms with experimental observations and with an accepted explanation for osteoporosis.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nParathyroid hormone temporal effects on bone formation and resorption, Martin H.

A PCEnv session is also associated with this model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nThe pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial (SA) node initiates the spontaneous beating of the heart.  Over the past decade a large body of data on the ionic currents underlying this pacemaker activity has been elucidated in patch-clamp experiments.  On the basis of this data, several mathematical models describing the pace maker activity of a single rabbit SA node cell have been developed.  These include:\n\n\nDemir et al. Sinoatrial Node Model, 1994;\n\n\nModelling the Ion Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity, Dokos et al., 1996;\n\n\nA Model of Sinoatrial Node Vagal Control, Dokos et al., 1996;\n\n\nDemir et al.

Sinoatrial Node Model, 2001.\n\n\nWith the elucidation of more experimental data, these models have become increasingly complex, with equations that describe calcium buffering, intracellular compartmentation, and additional ionic currents through channels, pumps and exchangers.  In the study by Kurata et al. described here, the aim is to develop an improved mathematical model of a single primary pacemaker cell of the rabbit SA node, in order to investigate the mechanisms underlying pacemaker generation.  On the basis of the most recent experimental data, Kurata et al. updated the previously published models (see list above) in several ways:\n\nA sustained inward current has been added (Ist\n).\nThe voltage- and Ca2+-dependent activation kinetics of the L-type calcium channel current (ICa,L\n) have been reformulated.\n2+\nExpressions for the activation kinetics of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr\n) have been updated.\nRevised kinetic equations for two 4-AP sensitive currents (Ito\n and Isus\n) have been incorporated.\nVoltage- and concentration-dependent kinetics of the Na+-K+ pump current (INaK\n) have been reformulated.\n+\n+\nThe subsarcolemmal space (see \n    the figure\n   below) as a diffusion barrier for intracellular Ca2+ has been added.\n2+\n\nThe model was validated by comparing simulation results with experimental data, and also by comparing them with those of previous mathematical models.  The authors concluded that their model represented a significant improvement over previous models because it can:\n\nSimulate whole cell voltage-clamp data for ICa,L\n, IKr\n, and Ist\n;\nReproduce the wave shapes of spontaneous action potentials and ionic currents during action potential clamp recordings; and\nMimic the effects of channel blockers or Ca 2+ buffers on pacemaker activity more accurately than the previous models.\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDynamical description of sinoatrial node pacemaking: improved mathematical model for primary pacemaker cell, Yasutaka Kurata, Ichiro Hisatome, Sunao Imanishi, and Toshishige Shibamoto, 2002, \nAmerican Journal of Physiology\n, 283, H2074-H2101.

This new model provides an improvement over previous models by introducing two nonlinear factors with physiological relevance: 1) a limit to gland size; 2) rejection of negative hormone concentrations. The result is that the new model is by far the most robust; e.g., it can tolerate at least -50% and +100% perturbations to any of its parameters. This high degree of robustness allows one, for the first time, to model features of the system such as circadian rhythm and response to hormone injections. In addition, relative to its closest predecessor, the model is simpler; it contains only about half of the parameters, and yet achieves more functions. The new model provides opportunities for teaching endocrinology within a biological or medical school context; it may also have applications in modeling and studying HPA axis disorders, for example, related to gland size dynamics, abnormal hormone levels, or stress influences. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling robust oscillatory behavior of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, Vadim Kyrylov, Liudmila A.

However the model in its present state does not recreate the published results.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A dynamic model of the glycogenolytic pathway to lactate in skeletal muscle was constructed with mammalian kinetic parameters obtained from the literature. Energetic buffers relevant to muscle were included. The model design features stoichiometric constraints, mass balance, and fully reversible thermodynamics as defined by the Haldane relation. We employed a novel method of validating the thermodynamics of the model by allowing the closed system to come to equilibrium; the combined mass action ratio of the pathway equaled the product of the individual enzymes' equilibrium constants. Adding features physiologically relevant to muscle-a fixed glycogen concentration, efflux of lactate, and coupling to an ATPase-allowed for a steady-state flux far from equilibrium. The main result of our analysis is that coupling of the glycogenolytic network to the ATPase transformed the entire complex into an ATPase driven system. This steady-state system was most sensitive to the external ATPase activity and not to internal pathway mechanisms. The control distribution among the internal pathway enzymes-although small compared to control by ATPase-depended on the flux level and fraction of glycogen phosphorylase a. This model of muscle glycogenolysis thus has unique features compared to models developed for other cell types. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Computational Model for Glycogenolysis in Skeletal Muscle, Melissa J.

CRH induces the secretion of ACTH through the actication of the cAMP second messenger system, which results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).  Secretion of ACTH alo requires an influx of Ca2+, which occurs mainly through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels.  Corticotrophs generate both spontaneous and CRG-induced action potentials.  L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are the main channel type that underlie Ca2+-induced action potential generation.  It is likely that following activation by CRH, PKA phosphorylates the L-type channel and promotes Ca2+ action potential generation with subsequent Ca2+ influx.  The rise in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), then leads to the activation of exocytotic pathways, resulting in the secretion of ACTH. \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nAlthough the PKA-induced action potential activity is known to play an important role in this secretory pathway, the mechanism by which PKA activates the L-type  Ca2+ channel is currently unknown.

They develop a Hodgkin-Huxley-type mathematical model of action potential generation in corticotrophs (see \n    the figure\n   below).

The favoured mechanism which was thought to underlie this increase in the L-type Ca2+ current was a shift in the voltage-dependence of the current towards more negative potentials.  The model also showed that the T-type Ca2+ current plays a role in establishing the excitability of the plasma membrane, but it doesn't plauy a major role in action potential generation.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+",

This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR to reproduce the diagrams in figure 4D-F (taking into account light-induced TIM degration via an oscillating v_dT). The initial conditions (for M_P, M_T, C_N, C, P_0, P_1, P_2, T_0, T_1, T_2) have been set after allowing the model to run till steady state to replicate figure4D-F. Note the rescaling of the publication diagrams for figure4E and F\nModel Structure\nAbstract: The authors present a model for circadian oscillations of the Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) proteins in Drosophila. The model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and TIM and on the negative feedback exerted by a nuclear PER-TIM complex on the transcription of the perand tim genes. Periodic behavior occurs in a large domain of parameter space in the form of limit cycle oscillations. These sustained oscillations occur in conditions corresponding to continuous darkness or to entrainment by light-dark cycles and are in good agreement with experimental observations on the temporal variations of PER and TIM and of per and tim mRNAs. Birhythmicity (coexistence of two periodic regimes) and aperiodic oscillations (chaos) occur in a restricted range of parameter values. The results are compared to the predictions of a model based on the sole regulation by PER. Both the formation of a complex between PER and TIM and protein phosphorylation are found to favor oscillatory behavior. Determining how the period depends on several key parameters allows us to test possible molecular explanations proposed for the altered period in the perl and pers mutants. The extended model further allows the construction of phase-response curves based on the light-induced triggering of TIM degradation. These curves, established as a function of both the duration and magnitude of the effect of a light pulse, match the phase-response curves obtained experimentally in the wild type and pers mutant of Drosophila.\nA Model for Circadian Rhythms in Drosophila Incorporating the Formation of a Complex between the PER and TIM Proteins, Leloup JC, Goldbeter A, 1998, Journal of Biological Rhythms, 13, 70-87 PubMed ID: 9486845\n",

These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nToward a detailed computational model for the mammalian circadian clock, Jean-Christophe Leloup and Albert Goldbeter, 2003,PNAS, 100, 7051-7056.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the mammalian circadian clock: sensitivity analysis and multiplicity of oscillatory mechanisms, Jean-Christophe Leloup and Albert Goldbeter, 2004, \n            Journal of Theoretical Biology, 230, 541-562.

For Drosophila, the molecular model is based on the negative feedback exerted on the expression of the per and tim genes by the complex formed between the PER and TIM proteins. For Neurospora, similarly, the model relies on the feedback exerted on the expression of the frq gene by its protein product FRQ. In both models, sustained rhythmic variations in protein and mRNA levels occur in continuous darkness, in the form of limit cycle oscillations. The effect of light on circadian rhythms is taken into account in the models by considering that it triggers degradation of the TIM protein in Drosophila, and frq transcription in Neurospora. When incorporating the control exerted by light at the molecular level, we show that the models can account for the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light-dark cycles and for the damping of the oscillations in constant light, though such damping occurs more readily in the Drosophila model. The models account for the phase shifts induced by light pulses and allow the construction of phase response curves. These compare well with experimental results obtained in Drosophila. The model for Drosophila shows that when applied at the appropriate phase, light pulses of appropriate duration and magnitude can permanently or transiently suppress circadian rhythmicity. We investigate the effects of the magnitude of light-induced changes on oscillatory behavior. Finally, we discuss the common and distinctive features of circadian oscillations in the two organisms.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nLimit Cycle Models for Circadian Rhythms Based on Transcriptional Regulation in Drosophila and Neurospora, Jean-Christophe Leloup, Didier Gonze, and Albert Goldbeter, 1999,  Journal of Biological Rhythms, 14, 433-448.

The model runs in both OpenCell and COR to recreate the published results.   The units are consistent throughout.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, two cell types specialized in the maintenance of the bone integrity. Bone is a dynamic, living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast activities in bone remodeling, Vincent Lemaire, Frank L.

A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P(2)Y(2) receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP(2) depletion and resupply on the time course of IP(3) and Ca2+ levels. Results of the modelling also reveal the importance of receptor recycling and PIP(2) resupply for maintaining Ca2+ and IP(3) levels during sustained application of agonist.\n        \n\n\tThe original paper is cited below:\n\t\n\n\tMetabotropic receptor activation, desensitization and sequestration-I: modelling calcium and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate dynamics following receptor activation.

Initially, a gastrointestinal absorption term for glucose is utilized to effect the glucose absorption by the intestine and the subsequent release of glucose into the bloodstream, taking place at a given initial rate and falling off exponentially with time. An analysis of the model is carried out by the singular perturbation technique in order to derive boundary conditions on the system parameters which identify, in particular, the existence of limit cycles in our model system consistent with the oscillatory patterns often observed in clinical data. We then utilize a sinusoidal term to incorporate the temporal absorption of glucose in order to study the responses in the patients under ambulatory-fed conditions. A numerical investigation is carried out in this case to construct a bifurcation diagram to identify the ranges of parametric values for which chaotic behavior can be expected, leading to interesting biological interpretations.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling insulin kinetics: responses to a single oral glucose administration or ambulatory-fed conditions.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis is the simple, minimal model based on the equations in the original published paper. The CellML model runs in both COR and OpenCell and the units are consistent. The model recreates figure 2 from the paper (gc=0 so the soma and the dendritic compartments are uncoupled), however - in order to get the frequency of oscillations correct (with a period of 2s) the variable alpha was set to 0.5 (as opposed to 0.173 which was given in the paper). This change has to be confirmed with the original model authors.\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Burst firing of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta can be induced in vitro by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate. It has been suggested that the interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump (Johnson et al. (1992) Science 258, 665-667). We formulate and explore a theoretical model, with a minimal number of currents, for this novel mechanism of burst generation. This minimal model is further developed into a more elaborate model based on observations of additional currents and hypotheses about their spatial distribution in dopaminergic neurons (Hounsgaard (1992) Neuroscience 50, 513-518; Llinas et al. (1984) Brain Res. 294, 127-132). Using the minimal model, we confirm that interaction between the regenerative, inward N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated current and the outward Na(+)-pump current is sufficient to generate the slow oscillation (approximately 0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The negative-slope region of the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel's current-voltage relation is indispensable for this slow rhythm generation. The time-scale of Na(+)-handling determines the burst's slow frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is best explained mechanistically by using at least two spatial, cable-like compartments: a soma where action potentials are produced and a dendritic compartment where the slow rhythm is generated. Our result is consistent with recent experimental evidence that burst generation originates in distal dendrites (Seutin et al. (1994) Neuroscience 58, 201-206). Responses of the model to a number of electrophysiological and pharmacological stimuli are consistent with known responses observed under similar conditions. These include the persistence of the slow rhythm when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is blocked and when the soma is voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Using our more elaborate model, we account for details of the observed frequency adaptation in N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of multiple spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the interaction between two different bursting mechanisms. Besides reproducing several well established firing patterns, this model also suggests that new firing modes, not yet recorded, might also occur in dopaminergic neurons. This model provides mechanistic insights and explanations into the origin of a variety of experimentally observed membrane potential firing patterns in dopaminergic neurons, including N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting and its dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of dopaminergic neurons, could be useful in further studies of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. It may also shed light on bursting that involves N-methyl-D-aspartate channel activity in other neuron types.\nThe original paper reference is cited below.\nModeling N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting in dopamine neurons, Y.X.

Parameter values have been taken from table 1 and di=0.06 and Gin=0.54 - as in figure 4.\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: In the glucose-insulin regulatory system, ultradian insulin secretory oscillations are observed to have a period of 50-150 min. After pioneering work traced back to the 1960s, several mathematical models have been proposed during the last decade to model these ultradian oscillations as well as the metabolic system producing them. These currently existing models still lack some of the key physiological aspects of the glucose-insulin system. Applying the mass conservation law, we introduce two explicit time delays and propose a more robust alternative model for better understanding the glucose-insulin endocrine metabolic regulatory system and the ultradian insulin secretory oscillations for the cases of continuous enteral nutrition and constant glucose infusion. We compare the simulation profiles obtained from this two time delay model with those from the other existing models. As a result, we notice many unique features of this two delay model. Based on our intensive simulations, we suspect that one of the possibly many causes of ultradian insulin secretion oscillations is the time delay of the insulin secretion stimulated by the elevated glucose concentration.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the glucose-insulin regulatory system and ultradian insulin secretory oscillations with two explicit time delays, Jiaxu Li, Yang Kuang, and Clinton C.

A number of mathematical models have been published that attempt to model the temporal [Ca2+]i oscillations.  Some, such as the Keizer and De Young model (see  The De Young-Keizer model, 1992) assume that IP3 is necessarily oscillatory.  They constructed a model of the IP3 receptor/channel by assuming that three equivalent and independent subunits are involved in Ca2+ conduction.  Each subunit has three binding sites: one for IP3, one for Ca2+ activation, and one for Ca2+ inactivation.  Thus, each subunit may exist in eight states with transitions governed by second-order (association) and first-order (dissociation) rate constants (see  below).  All three subunits must be in the state S110 (one IP3 and one activating Ca2+ bound) for the channel to be open and conducting.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nIn 1994, Yue-Xian Li and John Rinzel analysed the nine-variable De Young-Keizer model (1992) and reduced it to a two-variable system.  Their reduced system is analogous in form to the classic Hodgkin-Huxley equations (see The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952) for plasma membrane electrical excitability.  [Ca2+]i dynamics in this model thus involve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated excitability.  Assuming further that the binging of IP3 does not depend on Ca2+ occupancy at the inactivation site, Li and Rinzel obtain a \"minimal\" model which still retains the ability to reproduce experimental observations.\n\n2+\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nEquations for InsP3 Receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i Oscillations Derived from a Detailed Kinetic Model:  A Hodgkin-Huxley Like Formalism, Yue-Xian Li and John Rinzel, 1994, \nJournal of Theoretical Biology\n, 166, 461-473.

This is a set of three coupled differential equations, namely:\n\nOne equation for describing the calcium dynamics;\nOne equation which represents the gate-shutting variable h; and\nOne equation which describes the influx of extracellular calcium into the cell cytosol through the plasma membrane\n\nThe advantage of reducing the model to this set of three equations is that it more simple, yet it still retains the ability to explain oscillatory behaviours caused by the calcium dynamics.  All the model parameters have been set according to those which are provided in Figure 5(a) of the paper. \n\n\nThe raw CellML descriptions of the Li and Rinzel 1994 model can be downloaded in various formats as described in .\n",

Available biophysical data have been incorporated into the model to quantify the specific ultrastructural morphology, intracellular ion buffering, and time- and voltage-dependent currents and transport mechanisms of the rabbit atrial cell. When possible, mathematical expressions describing ionic currents identified in rabbit atrium are based on whole cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rabbit atrial myocytes. This membrane model is coupled to equations describing Na+, K+, and Ca2+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ buffering. The resulting formulation can accurately simulate the whole cell voltage-clamp data on which it is based and provides fits to a family of rabbit atrial cell action potentials obtained at 35 degrees C over a range of stimulus rates (0.2-3.0 Hz). The model is utilized to provide a qualitative prediction of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration transient during the action potential and to illustrate the interactions between membrane currents that underlie repolarization in the rabbit atrial myocyte. \n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of the action potential and underlying membrane currents in a rabbit atrial cell, D.

The model will also open in PCEnv but currently will not run as the model produces NaNs.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Alternans of cardiac repolarization is associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. At the cellular level, alternans involves beat-to-beat oscillation of the action potential (AP) and possibly Ca2+ transient (CaT). Because of experimental difficulty in independently controlling the Ca2+ and electrical subsystems, mathematical modeling provides additional insights into mechanisms and causality. Pacing protocols were conducted in a canine ventricular myocyte model with the following results: 1) CaT alternans results from refractoriness of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release system; alternation of the L-type calcium current has a negligible effect; 2) CaT-AP coupling during late AP occurs through the sodium-calcium exchanger and underlies AP duration (APD) alternans; 3) increased Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity extends the range of CaT and APD alternans to slower frequencies and increases alternans magnitude; its decrease suppresses CaT and APD alternans, exerting an antiarrhythmic effect; and 4) increase of the rapid delayed rectifier current (IKr) also suppresses APD alternans but without suppressing CaT alternans. Thus CaMKII inhibition eliminates APD alternans by eliminating its cause (CaT alternans) while IKr enhancement does so by weakening CaT-APD coupling. The simulations identify combined CaMKII inhibition and IKr enhancement as a possible antiarrhythmic intervention.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRegulation of Ca2+ and electrical alternans in cardiac myocytes: role of CAMKII and repolarizing currents, Leonid M.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model is currently non-functional.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nElectrical activity of the healthy mammalian heart is initiated by an area of specialised pacemaker cells in the wall of the heart, known as the sinoatrial node (SAN).  These cells are spontaneously active, demonstrating a slow depolarisation to threshold (pacemaker potential) rather than a stable resting potential.  Despite heterogeneity amongst the cells of the SAN, the cells are able to synchronise their firing rate and this in turn stimulates the contraction of the atrial myocardium.  Synchronisation is achieved by electronic coupling between cells via gap junctions.\n\n\nTo date, two potential theories have been put forward to explain the observed spatial heterogeneity in the action potential characteristics within the SAN:\n\n1) The gradient model suggests that the heterogeneity arises intrinsically from a spatial gradient in underlying cellular electrophysiological properties; and \n2) The mosaic model, which suggests that atrial myocytes are peppered throughout the SAN region, increasing in density towards the periphery.  Action potential heterogeneity then arises due to the electronic coupling between atrial and pacemaker myocytes, and the differences between the relative density of the two cell types with the SAN.\n\nIn order to further investigate the source of the action potential heterogeneity in the SAN, a mathematical model has been devloped by Lovell et al. (see the figure below).  Several mathematical models of the SAN activity have been previously published, including:\n\n\n              Demir et al. Sinoatrial Node Model, 1994;\n            \n\n              Modelling the Ion Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity, Dokos et al., 1996;\n            \n\n              A Model of Sinoatrial Node Vagal Control, Dokos et al., 1996;\n            \n\n              Demir et al. Sinoatrial Node Model, 1999;\n            \n\n              Zhang et al. Sinoatrial Node Model, 2000;\n            \n\n              Boyett et al. Sinoatrial Node Model, 2001;\n            \n\n              Kurata et al. Improved Mathematical Model for the Primary Pacemaker Cell, 2002.\n            \n\nAlthough these models were able to recreate the generic action potential waveforms from the SAN, none were able to represent action potential waveforms from any specific SAN cell.  This limits the application of such models to analyse the factors underlying action potential heterogeneity in coupled systems of pacemaker cells, as well as elucidating specific ionic mechanisms underlying action potential heterogeneity in the SAN.\n\n\nTo meet these needs, Lovell et al. have devloped a generic single cell ionic model of rabbit SAN cells, which is based on Markovian state kinetics (all previously published SAN models are based on a Hodgkin-Huxley mechanism).  Parameters are fitted to this model using a custom least squares optimisation approach.  They then propose a gradient model of the SAN by employing the same optimisation approach to fit a smooth transition in ionic model parameters to achieve a desired variation in AP characteristics.\n\n\nThe model has been described here in CellML.  It should be noted that the initial parameters entered into this model are those for the central SAN value.  Peripheral SAN values and the interpolation parameters are also provided in the original publication.    \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nProgress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology\n, 85, 301-323.

The units have been checked and are consistent, and the model runs in OpenCell and COR to replicate the published results (as shown in figure 12 of the paper).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: Here, we construct a mathematical model of the hypothalamic systems that control the secretion of growth hormone (GH). The work extends a recent model of the pituitary GH system, adding representations of the hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin neurones, each modelled as a single synchronised unit. An unpatterned stochastic input drives the GHRH neurones generating pulses of GHRH release that trigger GH pulses. Delayed feedback from GH results in increased somatostatin release, which inhibits both GH secretion and GHRH release, producing an overall pattern of 3-h pulses of GH secretion that is very similar to the secretory profile observed in male rats. Rather than directly stimulating somatostatin release, GH feedback triggers a priming effect, increasing releasable stores of somatostatin. Varying this priming effect to reduce the effect of GH can reproduce the less pulsatile form of GH release observed in the female rat. The model behaviour is tested by comparison with experimental observations with a range of different experimental protocols involving GHRH injections and somatostatin and GH infusion.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModelling the hypothalamic control of growth hormone secretion, D.

This model recreates the published results.\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: The Na-dependent, low affinity glucose transporter SGLT2 cloned from pig kidney is 76% identical (at the amino acid level) to its high affinity homologue SGLT1. Using two-microelectrode voltage clamp, we have characterized the presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of SGLT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The kinetic properties of the steady-state sugar-evoked currents as a function of external Na and a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMG) concentrations were consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which Na binds first. Na binding was voltage-dependent and saturated with hyperpolarizing voltages. Phlorizin was a potent inhibitor of the sugar-evoked currents (Ki ~10 mM) and blocked an inward Na current in the absence of sugar. SGLT2 exhibited Na-dependent presteadystate currents with time constants 3-7 ms. Charge movements were described by Boltzmann relations with apparent valence ~1 and maximal charge transfer ~11 nC, and were reduced by the addition of sugar or phlorizin. The differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 were that (i) the apparent affinity constant (K0.5) for aMG (~3 mM) was an order of magnitude higher for SGLT2; (ii) SGLT2 excluded galactose, suggesting discrete sugar binding; (iii) K0.5 for Na was lower in SGLT2; and (iv) the Hill coefficient for Na was 1 for SGLT2 but 2 for SGLT1. Simulations of the six-state kinetic model previously proposed for SGLT1 indicated that many of the kinetic properties observed in SGLT2 are expected by simply reducing the Na/glucose coupling from 2 to 1.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiophysical Characteristics of the Pig Kidney Na/Glucose Cotransporter SGLT2 Reveal a Common Mechanism for SGLT1 and SGLT2, M.

Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation.  At even higher glucose concentrations, continuous action potentials are seen.  This electrical activity has two important physiological correlates: increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and increased rate of insulin secretion during the active phase.  It is generally accepted that the rise in [Ca2+]i plays a major role in insulin secretion and that the action potential spikes during a burst are responsible for the rise in [Ca2+]i.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n  \nBecause the glucose signal for insulin secretion operates via metabolism rather than through a plasma membrane-bound receptor, the details of how glucose stimulates electrical activity have been difficult to resolve.  However, experimental data and theoretical models have begun to investigate the phenomenon.  In 1997 Gerhard Magnus and Joel Keizer published a minimal mathematical model to describe Ca2+ handling by mitochondria in the pancreatic beta-cell (see The Magnus-Keizer Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling Model, 1997).  Their kinetic model incorporated six transport mechanisms in the inner mitochondrial membrane, including proton pumping via respiration and proton pumping by the F0F1-ATPase, a proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the Ca2+ uniporter and Na+/Ca2+ exchange.  In their 1998 model, Gerhard Magnus and Joel Keizer continue their development of a kinetic model of bursting electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell.  Their minimal model of Ca2+ handling is expanded to include, amongst other factors, the glucose dependence of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing equivalents (see \n    the figure\n   below). \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n+\n2+\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel of beta-cell mitochondrial calcium handling and electrical activity.

However, no currently available detailed action potential model accurately reproduces the dynamics of the cardiac action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling at rapid heart rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35-37 degrees C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.\n\n\nThe original publication reference is cited below:\n\n\nA rabbit ventricular action potential model replicating cardiac dynamics at rapid heart rates, Mahajan A, Shiferaw Y, Sato D, Baher A, Olcese R, Xie LH, Yang MJ, Chen PS, Restrepo JG, Karma A, Garfinkel A, Qu Z, Weiss JN, 2008 Biophysical Journal, 94(2):392-410 PubMed ID: 18160660\n",

Some of the effects of this electrotonic coupling on the action potential waveform of the human ventricular myocyte have been analyzed in detail. The present study employs a recently developed mathematical model of the human atrial myocyte to investigate the consequences of this heterogeneous cell-cell interaction on the action potential of the human atrium. Two independent physiological processes which alter the physiology of the human atrium have been studied. i) The effects of the autonomic transmitter acetylcholine on the atrial action potential have been investigated by inclusion of a time-independent, acetylcholine-activated K+ current in this mathematical model of the atrial myocyte. ii) A non-selective cation current which is activated by natriuretic peptides has been incorporated into a previously published mathematical model of the cardiac fibroblast. These results identify subtle effects of acetylcholine, which arise from the nonlinear interactions between ionic currents in the human atrial myocyte. They also illustrate marked alterations in the action potential waveform arising from fibroblast-myocyte source-sink principles when the natriuretic peptide-mediated cation conductance is activated. Additional calculations also illustrate the effects of simultaneous activation of both of these cell-type specific conductances within the atrial myocardium. This study provides a basis for beginning to assess the utility of mathematical modeling in understanding detailed cell-cell interactions within the complex paracrine environment of the human atrial myocardium.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n        Mathematical simulations of ligand-gated and cell-type specific effects on the action potential of human atrium, Mary M.

This particular variant of the model uses the initial conditions from the paper (and is not intended to be a steady state model).\n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger current (I(NCX)). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca(2+) cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca(2+) releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD I(NCX) over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e.g., L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (\"funny\") current (I(f)) conductances]. The system Ca(2+) clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) fluxes, which optimize cell Ca(2+) balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca(2+) release and late DD I(NCX) as SR Ca(2+) pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1.8-4.6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca(2+) clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca(2+) clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD I(NCX) ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca(2+) clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSynergism of coupled subsarcolemmal Ca2+ clocks and sarcolemmal voltage clocks confers robust and flexible pacemaker function in a novel pacemaker cell model, Victor A.

AN example of an autocrine system is signalling through epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR).  A cell releases EGFR ligands into its environment, and a fraction of the released ligand is recaptured by the receptors at the cell surface.  The activated receptors then trigger a signal transduction cascade, whose effects range from cell proliferation to cell migration behaviour.  An additional effect can be the further production of EGFR ligands, producing a positive feedback loop which results in a sustained activity of the autocrine signalling circuit.  If, as hypothesised, this sustained autoendocrine circuit is localised within a defined domain of the cell, then it may contribute to the intrinsic cell polarity or assymmetry.  \n\n\nThe difficulty associated with the experimental investigation of autoendocrine signalling makes computational modelling especially valuable when trying to deduce nature of the molecular mechanisms underlying signalling circuits.  In the Maly et al. 2004 publication described here, the authors develop and analyse a dymanic computational model of autocrine EGFR signalling.  Their description is based on integrating select elements from the models of  Kholodenko et al., Quantification of EGF Receptor Signalling, 1999, and of Huang and Ferrell, MAPK Cascade, 1996, into the existing model of EGFR aurocrine signalling bt Shvartsman et al., 2002. \n\n\nIt should be noted that although the original Maly et al. model is a spatially distributed dynamic computational model, the spatial parameters in this CellML description have been removed, as CellML is currently unable to handle spatial parameters.

Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComplex calcium oscillations and the role of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins, Marko Marhl, Thomas Haberichter, Milan Brumen and Reinhart Heinrich, 2000, Biosystems, 57, 75-86.

It is a faithful reproduction of the paper equations, and the output is similar (but not identical) to the published results (Fig 5).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We propose a simple mathematical model of liver S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) metabolism. Analysis of the model has shown that AdoMet metabolism can operate under two different modes. The first, with low metabolic rate and low AdoMet concentration, serves predominantly to supply the cell with AdoMet, the substrate for various cellular methylation reactions. The second, with high metabolic rate and high AdoMet concentration, provides an avenue for cleavage of excess methionine and can serve as a source of cysteine when its increased synthesis is necessary. The switch that triggers interconversion between the \"low\" and \"high\" modes is methionine concentration. Under a certain set of parameters both modes may coexist. This behavior results from the kinetic properties of (i) the two isoenzymes of AdoMet synthetase, MATI and MATIII, that catalyse AdoMet production; one is inhibited by AdoMet, whereas the other is activated by it, and (ii) glycine-N-methyltransferase that displays highly cooperative kinetics that is different from that of other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. Thus, the model provides an explanation for how different cellular needs are met by regulation of this pathway. The model also correctly identifies a critical role for glycine N-methyltransferase in depleting excess methionine in the high mode, thus avoiding the toxicity associated with elevated levels of this essential amino acid.   \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Substrate Switch: A New Mode of Regulation in the Methionine Metabolic Pathway, Michael V.

Initial rate analysis was performed by hyperbolic regression of initial rates using the program HYPERFIT. Glyoxalase I exhibited saturation kinetics on 0.05-2.5 mM hemithioacetal concentration range, with kinetic parameters Km 0.53 +/- 0.07 mM and V (3.18 +/- 0.16) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1). Glyoxalase II also showed saturation kinetics in the SD-lactoylglutathione concentration range of 0.15-3 mM and Km 0.32 +/- 0.13 mM and V (1.03 +/- 0.10) x 10(-3) mM.min(-1) were obtained. The kinetic parameters of both enzymes were also estimated by nonlinear regression of progress curves using the raw absorbance data and integrated differential rate equations with the program GEPASI. Several optimization methods were used to minimize the sum of squares of residuals. The best parameter fit for the glyoxalase I reaction was obtained with a single curve analysis, using the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model. The kinetic parameters obtained, Km 0.62 +/- 0.18 mM and V (2.86 +/- 0.01) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1), were in agreement with those obtained by initial rate analysis. The results obtained for glyoxalase II, using either the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model or a phenomenological reversible hyperbolic model, showed a high correlation of residuals with time and/or high values of standard deviation associated with Km. The possible causes for the discrepancy between data obtained from initial rate analysis and progress curve analysis, for glyoxalase II, are discussed.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIn situ kinetic analysis of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Margarida Martins, A. et al, 2001, European Journal of Biochemistry, 268, 3930-3936.

Particular attention is paid to the overload caused by diminished activity of the sodium-potassium pump. It is shown in the framework of the model, where mechano-calcium feedback is accounted for that myocardium mechanics may significantly enhance arrhythmogenicity of the calcium overload. Specifically, a role of cross-bridge attachment/detachment processes, a role of mechanical conditions of myocardium contractions (length, load), and a role of myocardium viscosity in the case of simulated calcium overload have been revealed. Underlying mechanisms are analyzed. Several approaches are designed in the model and compared to each other for recovery of the valid myocardium electrical and mechanical performance in the case of the partially suppressed sodium-potassium pump. \n\nPanel I: Scheme of the ionic currents accounted for in the cardiomyocyte model.

It also works in JSim as long as the stimulus protocol is altered. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nDifferent types of ion channel, with their distinct gating and conductance properties, play a unique role in generating membrane excitation.  Although the behaviours of single ion channels have been extensively studied experimentally, ionic current interactions make it difficult to deduce their individual roles in membrane excitability.  In order to better understand the roles of the individual ion currents, Satoshi Matsuoka et al. have developed a mathematical model of membrane excitation for the ventricular cell. \n\n\nThe Matsuoka et al. mathematical model is a development of previously published cardiac cellular models.  The group's general approach to modelling was based on the methods used in the Difrancesco-Noble, 1985 Model and the Luo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994.  In addition, the compound Kyoto Model of Matsuoka et al. incorporates the Negroni and Lascano (1996) model of cardiac muscle contraction, allowing simulation of sarcomere shortening, and also, the gating model of Shirokov et al. is used for both the fast Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels.   \n\n+\n2+\n\nNew experimental data are included, such as new kinetics of the inward rectifier K+ channel, the delayed rectifier K+ channel, and the sustained inward current (for more details on the reaction kinetics, see figure 3 below).  Model simulations showed that ion conductance by the L-type Ca2+ channel (ICaL) dominates the membrane conductance during the action potential.  Repolarisation occurs as the following currents are sequentially activated: IKs; IKr; and IK1.  Agreement between model simulation results and experimental data was taken as supporting evidence for the validity of the model. \n\n+\n+\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRole of Individual Ionic Current Systems in Ventricular Cells Hypothesized by a Model Study, Matsuoka S, Sarai N, Kuratomi S, Ono K, and Noma A, 2003, The Japanese Journal of Physiology, 53, 105-123.

It reproduces the published results and is representative of the Minimal ROM. Validation was done in both CellML and Matlab, Matlab was used to simulate variations in GAP and R concentrations and to reproduce figure 5C. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Biochemical systems embed complex networks and hence development and analysis of their detailed models pose a challenge for computation. Coarse-grained biochemical models, called reduced-order models (ROMs), consisting of essential biochemical mechanisms are more useful for computational analysis and for studying important features of a biochemical network. The authors present a novel method to model-reduction by identifying potentially important parameters using multidimensional sensitivity analysis. A ROM is generated for the GTPase-cycle module of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Gq, and regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (a GTPase-activating protein or GAP) starting from a detailed model of 48 reactions. The resulting ROM has only 17 reactions. The ROM suggested that complexes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and GAP--which were proposed in the detailed model as a hypothesis--are required to fit the experimental data. Models previously published in the literature are also simulated and compared with the ROM. Through this comparison, a minimal ROM, that also requires complexes of GPCR and GAP, with just 15 parameters is generated. The proposed reduced-order modelling methodology is scalable to larger networks and provides a general framework for the reduction of models of biochemical systems.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nReduced-order modelling of biochemical networks: application to the GTPase-cycle signalling module, Mano R.

Mutations in KCNE2 have been associated with acquired long-QT syndrome and ventricular fibrillation, whilst mutations in the HERG gene have been associated with the inherited form of the disease.  The mechansisms underlying the KCNE mutation-induced cardiac arrhythmias are not clear.  An improved understanding of the functional interactions between the two gene products could facilitate the development of superior therapeutic approaches for particular lesions in either HERG or KCNE2.\n\n\nIn the study described here, Mazhari et al. characterise the functional effects of KCNE2 coexpression with HERG.  They develop a Markov state model of both HERG and HERG-KCNE2 coassembly (see \n    the figure\n   below), and use this model to elucidate mechanisms of interaction.  In addition, ion channel gating models provide a quantitative description of gating behaviour and they provide clues to channel strcture.  In order to predict the consequences of HERG-KCNE2 interactions for action potential repolarisation, the Markov state model was embedded within the Winslow et al. Canine Ventricular Cell Model, 1999. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMolecular Interactions Between Two Long-QT Syndrome Gene Products, HERG and KCNE2, Rationalized by In Vitro and In Silico Analysis, Reza Mazhari, Joseph L.

(Full text (HTML) and PDF versions of the article are available on the Circulation Research website.)  PubMed ID: 11440975\n\n\nWhile coexpression of HERG and KCNE2 alters both the kinetics and density of the ionic current, including these effects in the Winslow et al. action potential model predicts that only changes in current density significantly affect repolarisation.  Therefore the main functional consequence of KCNE2 on action potential morphology is through modulation of IK,r density.  The mutations associated with long-QT syndrome that result in only modest changes of gating kinetics may be an epiphenomena or alternatively, they may modulate action potential repoalrisation via interactions with alternative pore-forming potassium channel alpha subunits. \n",

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model contains partial differentials and as such can not currently be solved by existing CellML tools.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nIn many cell types, Ca2+ acting as a signalling agent plays an important role in the control of cellular function.  It is thought that these signals are mediated through oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i).  The mechanisms underlying these oscillations are complex and they have only been partially elucidated.  In addition, in larger cells such as in the Xenopus laevis oocyte, a variety of Ca2+ wave behaviour has been seen, including plane waves, pulsating patterns and spiral waves.  This has lead to the frequent use of Xenopus oocytes in experimental studies of Ca2+ waves. \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThe probability of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor being in the open state is influenced by both IP3 and Ca2+.  This duel system of control is thought to underlie Ca2+ waves and oscillations.  IP3 binding to the receptor activates the channel, causing a small amount of Ca2+ to diffuse out of the ER into the cytosol.  This Ca2+ has a positive feedback effect, called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), and it is thought to underlie Ca2+ wave propagation.  At intermediate IP3 concentrations, a stable limit cycle appears in the kinetics, and the model becomes oscillatory.  Under these conditions, wave propagation can occur even without excitability.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nSeveral mathematical models for Ca2+ wave propagation have been published (for some examples see DeYoung and Keizer's IP3-mediated Ca2+ release model, 1992 and Li and Rinzel's IP3-mediated Ca2+ oscillations model, 1994), all of which are similar.  The mathematical model described here was published by McKenzie and Sneyd in 1998 (see \n    the figure\n   below).  It describes the process by which IP3 diffuses through the cytosol and binds to receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  These receptors also function as Ca2+ channels.  They open upon IP3 binding, and Ca2+ diffuses out of the ER down its electrochemical gradient into the cytosol.  Ca2+ is pumped against its electrochemical gradient out of the cytosol into the ER, and ions also leak into the cytosol from the ER and the external environment as they diffuse into the cytosol down their electrochemical gradient.  \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nModel simulations showed that spiral waves could be induced by simulating the release of IP3.  Increasing the size of the IP3 additions caused a decrease in the rotation period and the breakup of the spiral wave solutions.  Following this, irregular spatio-temporal patterns occurred.  From their model simulations, the authors predict that a simple experimental procedure may be sufficient to reproduce unstable spiral waves.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nOn the Formation and Breakup of Spiral Waves of Calcium, A.

We have proposed that the Phase 1 response results from the combined depolarizing influences of potassium channel closure and an inward, nonselective cation current (ICRAN) that activates as intracellular calcium stores empty during exposure to basal glucose (Bertram et al., 1995). The stores refill during Phase 1, deactivating ICRAN and allowing steady-state bursting to commence. We support this hypothesis with additional simulations and experimental results indicating that Phase 1 duration is sensitive to the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. First, the duration of the Phase 1 transient increases with duration of prior exposure to basal (2.8 mM) glucose, reflecting the increased time required to fill calcium stores that have been emptying for longer periods. Second, Phase 1 duration is reduced when islets are exposed to elevated K+ to refill calcium stores in the presence of basal glucose. Third, when extracellular calcium is removed during the basal glucose exposure to reduce calcium influx into the stores, Phase 1 duration increases. Finally, no Phase 1 is observed following hyperpolarization of the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide in the continued presence of 11 mm glucose, a condition in which intracellular calcium stores remain full. Application of carbachol to empty calcium stores during basal glucose exposure did not increase Phase 1 duration as the model predicts. Despite this discrepancy, the good agreement between most of the experimental results and the model predictions provides evidence that a calcium release-activated current mediates the Phase 1 electrical response of the pancreatic beta-cell.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nEvidence That Calcium Release-activated Current Mediates the Biphasic Electrical Activity of Mouse Pancreatic Journal name, edition, firstpage-lastpage.

(Circ. Res 1999, 84:571-586) by incorporating equations for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) buffering and transport by ATP and ADP and equations for MgATP regulation of ion transporters (Na(+)-K(+) pump, sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) pumps). The results indicate that, under normal conditions, Ca(2+) binding by low-affinity ATP and diffusion of CaATP may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The model also suggests that a fall in ATP/ADP ratio significantly reduces sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) content, increases diastolic Ca(2+), lowers systolic Ca(2+), increases Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels, and decreases the efficiency of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in extruding Ca(2+) during periodic voltage-clamp stimulation. The analysis suggests that the most important reason for these changes during metabolic inhibition is the down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase pump by reduced diastolic MgATP levels. High Ca(2+) concentrations developed near the membrane might have a greater influence on Mg(2+), ATP, and ADP concentrations than that of the lower Ca(2+) concentrations in the bulk myoplasm. The model predictions are in general agreement with experimental observations measured under normal and pathological conditions.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel study of ATP and ADP buffering, transport of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), and regulation of ion pumps in ventricular myocyte, Anushka Michailova and Andrew McCulloch, 2001, Biophysical Journal, 81, 614-629.

The new model: 1), quantitatively reproduces a dose-response relationship for the effects of changes in ATP on K(ATP) current, 2), simulates effects of ADP in modulating ATP sensitivity of K(ATP) channel, 3), predicts activation of Ca(2+) current during rapid increase in MgATP, and 4), demonstrates that decreased ATP/ADP ratio with normal total Mg(2+) or increased free Mg(2+) with normal ATP and ADP activate K(ATP) current, shorten action potential, and alter ionic currents and intracellular Ca(2+) signals.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n           This CellML model represents the smooth muscle cell described in the published paper (equations 20-27). The model runs in both OpenCell and COR and the units are consistent. However the model does not replicate the results in figure 2 of the paper - this is most likely to be due to a lack of a stimulus input. The original paper describes several cell types which are linked together, and a mechanical stimulus which is detected by a neuron (eq. 31). Therefore to get this model to run correctly the other cell models will have to be coded up and linked together. CellML 1.1 is suited for this purpose.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A complete mathematical model of the periodic myoelectrical activity of a functional unit of the small intestine is presented. Based on real morphological and electrophysiological data, the model assumes that: the functional unit is an electromyogenic syncytium; the kinetics of L-type Ca2+, T-type Ca2+, Ca2+-activated K+, voltage dependent K+and Cl-channels determine the electrical activity of the functional unit; the enteric nervous system is satisfactorily represented by an efferent cholinergic neuron that provides an excitatory input to the functional unit through receptor-linked L-type Ca2+channels and by an afferent pathway composed of the primary and secondary sensory neurons; the dynamics of propagation of the wave of depolarization along the unmyelinated nerve axons satisfy the Hodgkin-Huxley model; the electrical activity of the neural soma reflects the interaction of N-type Ca2+channels, Ca2+-activated K+and voltage dependent Na+, K+and Cl-channels; the smooth muscle syncytium of the locus is a null-dimensional contractile system. With the proposed model the dynamics of active force generation are determined entirely by the concentration of cytosolic calcium. The model describes: the mechanical excitation of the free nerve endings of the mechanoreceptor of the receptive field of the pathway; the electrical processes of the propagation of excitation along the afferent and efferent neural circuits; the chemical mechanisms of nerve-pulse transmission at the synaptic zones; the slow wave and bursting type electrical activity; cytosolic calcium concentration; the dynamics of active force generation. Numerical simulations have shown that the model can display different electrical patterns and mechanical responses of the locus. The results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of experiments conducted on the small intestine.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nNumerical Simulation of Motility Patterns of the Small Bowel. 1.

We used the latch regulation scheme of Hai and Murphy (Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 255:C86-C94, 1988) integrated with Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. This analysis showed that imposed length fluctuations decrease the mean number of attached bridges, depress muscle force and stiffness, and increase force-length hysteresis. At frequencies >0.1 Hz, the bond-length distribution of slowly cycling latch bridges changed little over the stretch cycle and contributed almost elastically to muscle force, but the rapidly cycling cross-bridge distribution changed substantially and dominated the hysteresis. By contrast, at frequencies greater than 0.033 Hz this behavior was reversed: the rapid cycling cross-bridge distribution changed little, effectively functioning as a constant force generator, while the latch bridge bond distribution changed substantially and dominated the stiffness and hysteresis. The analysis showed the dissociation of force/length hysteresis and cross-bridge cycling rates when strain amplitude exceeds 3%; that is, there is only a weak coupling between net external mechanical work and the ATP consumption required for cycling cross-bridges during the oscillatory steady state. Although these results are specific to airway smooth muscle, the approach generalizes to other smooth muscles subjected to cyclic length fluctuations.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nPerturbed Equilibria of Myosin Binding in Airway Smooth Muscle: Bond-Length Distributions, Mechanics, and ATP Metabolism, Srboljub M.

The mechanism of this intriguing energetics remained unknown. To get insights into this mechanism, we simulated myocardial cooling mechanoenergetics using basic Ca2+ and CB kinetics. We assumed that both adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake and CB detachment decelerated with cooling. We also assumed that all the ATPase-independent SR Ca2+ release, Ca2+ binding to and dissociation from troponin, and CB attachment remained unchanged. The simulated cooling shifted the CB force-free Ca2+ concentration curve to a lower Ca2+ concentration, increasing the Ca2+ responsiveness of CB force generation, and increased the maximum Ca2+-activated force. The simulation most importantly showed that these cooling effects combined led to a constant contractile efficiency when Ca2+ uptake and CB detachment rate constants changed appropriately. This result seems to account for our experimentally observed constant contractile efficiency under cooling inotropy.    \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\tMechanism of constant contractile efficiency under cooling inotropy of myocardium: simulation, Takeshi Mikane, Junichi Araki, Kunihisa Kohno, Yasunori Nakayama, Shunsuke Suzuki, Juichiro Shimizu, Hiromi Matsubara, Masahisa Hirakawa, Miyako Takaki, and Hiroyuki Suga,  1997, American Journal of Physiology, 273, H2891-H2898.

This model is useful for three reasons: (1) Its simplicity, comparable to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, makes it useful in numerical simulations, especially in two or three spatial dimensions where numerical efficiency is so important. (2) It can be understood analytically without recourse to numerical simulations. This allows us to determine rather completely how the parameters in the model affect its behavior which in turn provides insight into the effects of the many parameters in more realistic models. (3) It naturally gives rise to a one-dimensional map which specifies the action potential duration as a function of the previous diastolic interval. For certain parameter values, this map exhibits a new phenomenon--subcritical alternans--that does not occur for the commonly used exponential map.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n          A two-current model for the dynamics of cardiac membrane, Colleen C.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model should work in OpenCell and COR to reproduce published results. The a model is based on equations 2 (wihout mitochondria) and the b model is based on equatios 2 and 3 (with mitochondria). Six other versions are as follows: 2a and 2b = equations 3 and 4, 3a and 3b = equations 5 and 6, 4a and 4b = equations 7 and 8. Does not reproduce published results but runs in OpenCell.\nModel Structure\n\nIn a mathematical model for simple calcium oscillations [Biophys. Chem. 71 (1998) 125], it has been shown that mitochondria play an important role in the maintenance of constant amplitudes of cytosolic Ca[2+] oscillations. Simple plausible rate laws for [Ca+] fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane have been used in this model. Here we show that it is possible to use the same rate laws as a plug-in element in other existing mathematical models and obtain the same effect on amplitude regulation. This result appears to be universal, independent of the type of model and the type of Ca oscillations. We demonstrate this on two models for spiking Ca oscillations [J. Biol. Chem. 266 (1991) 11068; Cell Calcium 14 (1993) 311] and on two recent models for bursting Ca oscillations; one of them being a receptor-operated model [Biophys. J. 79 (2000) 1188] and the other one being a store-operated model [BioSystems 57 (2000) 75].\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n'Mitochondria regulate the amplitude of simple and \ncomplex calcium oscillations', Vladimir Grubelnik, Ann Zahle Larsen, Ursula Kummer, Lars Folke Olsen, Marko Marhl, 2001 Biophysical Chemistry, 94, 59-74.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model runs in both OpenCell and COR however we are uncertain as to whether or not the CellML model replicates the original model from the published paper as there are no validation figures to compare it against. The CellML model is based on equatiosn 10a to 10e.  Parameter values for the variables k and p are not stated in the paper so in the CellML model these were taken from a previously published model by the same author (Perelson et al. 1996).  The units have been checked and they are consistent. Note that while the model does run in COR, since the unit of time is days the model is not ideally suited for running in COR.\n          \nModel Structure\n ABSTRACT: We present and analyze a model for the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with target cells that includes a time delay between initial infection and the formation of productively infected cells. Assuming that the variation among cells with respect to this 'intracellular' delay can be approximated by a gamma distribution, a high flexible distribution that can mimic a variety of biologically plausible delays, we provide analytical solutions for the expected decline in plasma virus concentration after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy with one or more protease inhibitors. We then use the model to investigate whether the parameters that characterize viral dynamics can be identified from biological data. Using non-linear least-squares regression to fit the model to simulated data in which the delays conform to a gamma distribution, we show that good estimates for free viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and parameters characterizing the gamma distribution can be obtained. For simulated data sets in which the delays were generated using other biologically plausible distributions, reasonably good estimates for viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and mean delay times can be obtained using the gamma-delay model. For simulated data sets that include added simulated noise, viral clearance rate estimates are not as reliable. If the mean intracellular delay is known, however, we show that reasonable estimates for the viral clearance rate can be obtained by taking the harmonic mean of viral clearance rate estimates from a group of patients. These results demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate distributed intracellular delays into existing models for HIV dynamics and to use these refined models to estimate the half-life of free virus from data on the decline in HIV-1 RNA following treatment. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nInfluence of Delayed Viral Production on Viral Dynamics in HIV-1 Infected Patients, John E.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis CellML model is the model which was used to produce the original results in the paper, and therefore it is known to be completely accurate.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT:  Cardiac hypertrophy is a known risk factor for heart disease, and at the cellular level is caused by a complex interaction of signal transduction pathways. The IP3 - calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data we construct a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by a hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1), in the mouse atrial cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient; including the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and binding kinetics to precoupled (with G{alpha}GDP) receptor, and the kinetics associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics associated with the receptor system contribute to the behaviour of the system to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterising for a second hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway. \nAbstract reproduced from Cooling et al., Biophysical Journal 93, 2007, with permission.\nThis model of the NFAT cycling system is described in more depth in the original paper which is cited below:\nModeling hypertrophic IP3 transients in the cardiac myocyte, Michael Cooling, Peter Hunter and Edmund J. Crampin, 2007,\n\t\t\t\tBiophysical Journal, 93, 3421-3433.  PubMed ID: 17693463\n\nSchematic diagram of the model showing the reaction scheme of the IP3 production system. The extracellular ligand (L) binds to receptors (R), whether precoupled with GaGDP (Gd, yielding Rlg) or not (Rl). Fully activated receptors (Rlg) release GaGTP (Gt), which, along with calcium (Ca), stimulates PLCb (P). In the unstimulated state, PLCb-Ca21 (Pc) hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce IP3 via reaction R14. When stimulated, PLCb-Ca21-GaGTP (Pcg) hydrolyses PIP2 at a faster rate via reaction R15. Free IP3 is degraded via reaction R16.\n\n\tRelated models: A more modular version of this model is available at Modeling Biological Modularity with CellML.\n\t",

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.  \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and T cell interaction, Helen Moore and Natasha K.

The model runs in both OpenCell and COR, and the units are consistent, however it does not replicate the published results (figure 6).\n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nVoltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber, Morris C and Lecar H, 1981, Biophysical Journal, 35, 193-213.

Because the transmembrane distributions of many ions such as Na+, K+ and Ca2+ are far from equilibrium, cells are inclined towards excitable electrical activity, or the membrane potential, determined by relative charge distribution, exhibits complicated patterns of slow and fast oscillations associated with variations in the transmembrane ionic currents.  These dynamics play an essential role in intracellular function and intercellular communication.  \n\n+\n+\n2+\n\nWhen exposed to a threshold concentration of glucose, pancreatic beta-cells exhibit a complicated pattern of electrical activity.  Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation.  Insulin secretion is dependent on the relative amount of time the cells spend in the active state, and this time increases with the concentration of extracellular glucose.  Bursting dynamics control the influx of Ca2+ into the cell, and in turn, Ca2+ triggers the release of insulin.  So, via this mechanism, the bursting dynamics of the pancreatic beta-cells regulate their response to varying glucose concentrations.  Below a threshold glucose concentration (about 5mM), the cells do not burst.  Above a certain concentration (> 22 mM), the cells display continuous spiking, and insulin secretion becomes saturated. \n\n2+\n2+\n\nMathematical models of pancreatic beta-cells are usually based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (for the original model see The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952), with elaborations to account for Ca2+ storage, glucose metabolism, and regulation by ATP and various hormones.  Several models have been published (see the CellML repository for more pancreatic beta-cell and calcium oscillation models), but although some have been established for some years, their bifurcation structure is so complicated it is not yet fully understood.  The goal of the 2001 Mosekilde et al. paper analysed here was to give an accurate, but simplified account of the bifurcation structure of the individual beta-cell (see \n    the figure\n   below).\n\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nBifurcation structure of a model of bursting pancreatic cells, Erik Mosekilde, Brian Lading, Sergiy Yanchuk and Yuri Maistrenko, 2001, \nBiosystems\n, 63, 3-13.

Specifically, systems of nephrons, the operational units of the kidney, are modelled and the dynamics of such systems are explored. Nephron behaviour can fluctuate widely and, under certain conditions, become chaotic. However, the behaviour of the whole kidney remains remarkably stable and blood solute levels are maintained under a wide range of conditions even when many nephrons are damaged or lost. A network model is used to investigate the stability of systems of nephrons and interactions between nephrons. More sophisticated dynamics are explored including the observed oscillations in single nephron filtration rates and the development of stable ionic and osmotic gradients in the inner medulla which contribute to the countercurrent exchange mechanism. We have used the model to explore the effects of changes in input parameters including hydrostatic and osmotic pressures and concentrations of ions, such as sodium and chloride. The intrinsic nephron control, tubuloglomerular feedback, is included and the effects of coupling between nephrons are explored in two-, eight- and 72-nephron models.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computational model for emergent dynamics in the kidney, Moss R, Kazmierczak E, Kirley M, and Harris P, 2009, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 367, 2125-40.

Please note that this CellML model corresponds to the reduced 6-node network, not the full 106-node network.  Also, we have chosen the parameters such that the model recreates figure 4B in the paper (experiment 3, where there is a stimulus of MSH at 0\u20135 min followed by a stimulus of FGF at 5\u201310 min).  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MC1R) receptors stimulates B-Raf and C-Raf isoforms that regulate the dynamics of MAPK1,2 signaling. Network topology motifs in mammalian cells include feed-forward and feedback loops and bifans where signals from two upstream molecules integrate to modulate the activity of two downstream molecules. We computationally modeled and experimentally tested signal processing in the FGFR/MC1R/B-Raf/C-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in human melanoma cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR leads to\nsustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends critically on the expression level and connectivity to C-Raf, which is critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Further reducing a 106-node ordinary differential equations network encompassing the complete network to a 6-node network encompassing rate-limiting processes sustains the feedback loops and the bifan, providing sufficient information to predict biological responses.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nNetwork topology determines dynamics of the mammalian MAPK1,2 signaling network: bifan motif regulation of C-Raf and B-Raf isoforms by FGFR and MC1R, Melissa Muller, Mandri Obeyesekere, Gordon B.

A two-dimensional musculoskeletal model which consisted of four rigid segments, three joints, and six Hill-type muscle models, representing the six major muscles and muscle groups in the lower extremity that contribute to jumping performance, was trained systematically. Maximum isometric muscle force, maximum muscle shortening velocity, and maximum muscle activation, which were manipulated to simulate the effects of strength training, all had substantial effects on jumping performance. Part of the increase in jumping performance could be explained solely by the interaction between the three neuromuscular parameters. It appeared that the most effective way to improve jumping performance was to train the knee extensors among all lower extremity muscles. For the model to fully benefit from any training effects of the neuromuscular system, it was necessary to continue to reoptimize the muscle coordination, in particular after the strength training sessions that focused on increasing maximum isometric muscle force. \n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\nEffects of Neuromuscular Strength Training on Vertical Jumping Performance - A Computer Simulation Study, Akinori Nagano and Karin G.M.

Following a stimulus, Ca2+ flows into the cytoplasm through channels in the cell membrane, and it's released from intracellular stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum.  Normal [Ca2+] is resumed by the actions of Ca2+ pumps, exchangers, binding proteins (CBPs) and other buffers.  Calbindin-D28k is a CBP which is present at high cytosolic concentrations in neurons such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal granule cells.

Underlying these potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias are reentrant electrical sources, or rotating spiral waves of excitation, and it has been shown that each class of cardiac arrhythmia is associated with a particular type of spiral wave.  Sudden cardiac death during ventricular fibrillation results in a compromised mechanical pump function of the heart.  Disrupted patterns of electrical excitation during ventricular fibrillation results in desynchronised cardiac contractions.  \n\n\nMathematical modelling is a useful technique for investigating the electrical activity of the heart.  Over the past 40 years models have also been used to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of reentrant arrhythmias in 2D, 3D, and in anatomically accurate geometric models of the heart.  The mathematical models are based on physiological data, and in parallel with the increasing sophistication of experimental techniques, the mathematical models has also evolved in their complexity and biological accuracy.  Previously, mathematical models have tended to focus on either the electrical properties of the heart, or on cardiac mechanics.  In the study described here, Nash and Panfilov establish a mathematical model which combines the effects of cardiac mechanics and electrical activity during arrhythmia. \n\n\nThe model described here in CellML is based on the Nash and Panfilov 2004 paper, which describes an electromechanical model of excitable tissue, which is used to study reentrant cardiac arrhythmias.  This mathematical model is a version of the modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model, published by Aliev and Panfilov in 1996 (for details on the original model please see The FitzHugh-Nagumo Model, 1961). While the original two-variable model described a non-dimensional activation variable (u) and a non-dimensional recovery variable (v), here Nash and Panfilov formulate the model in terms of the real action potential given by the time course of the transmembrane potential (Vm). In so doing, the time rate of change of the activation variable describes the total ionic current through the membrane with the original model parameters adjusted to give the correct dimensionality.  This 1996 version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model has been further modified by Nash and Panfilov in this 2004 study to include the simplest model of active tension development.\n\n\nThe main equations in the paper are Eqn 22abc and Eqn 23.  When the first author of this paper converted the model into CellML, he noticed two main errors in the original paper:\n\nEqn 22b: b should be a, and\nEqn 23: the factor 10 should be on first case line (V is less than 0.05). The second case should have the factor 1.\nA new set of model parameters is also used.\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nElectromechanical model of excitable tissue to study reentrant cardiac arrhythmias, M.

For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100%, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection..\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of HIV-1 pathogenesis that includes an intracellular delay, Patrick W.

This file is known to run in OpenCell and COR, and uses the parameters values in Tables 1, 2, and 3 of the paper. One of the units (for the variable theta) has been changed from micro_L (in the paper), to per_micro_L, to be dimensionally consistent. Parameters in years are represented in day equivalents. The CellML model simulation will replicate the graph traces in figure 2 of the paper. Note that in the paper, some figures are scaled logarithmically.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: The administration of a genetically engineered defective interfering virus (DIV) that interferes with HIV-1 replication has been proposed as a therapy for HIV-1 infection and AIDS. The proposed interfering virus, which is designed to superinfect HIV-1 infected cells, carries ribozymes that cleave conserved regions in HIV-1 RNA that code for the viral envelope protein. Thus DIV infection of HIV-1 infected cells should reduce or eliminate viral production by these cells. The success of this therapeutic strategy will depend both on the intercellular interaction of DIV and HIV-1, and on the overall dynamics of virus and T cells in the body. To study these dynamical issues, we have constructed a mathematical model of the interaction of HIV-1, DIV, and CD4+ cells in vivo. The results of both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that survival of the engineered DIV purely on a peripheral blood HIV-1 infection is unlikely. However, analytical results indicate that DIV might well survive on HIV-1 infected CD4+ cells in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and spleen, or on other HIV-1 infected cells in these organs.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nModeling defective interfering virus therapy for AIDS: conditions for DIV survival, Nelson G, Perelson A, 1995, Mathematical Biosciences, 125, 127-153.

The analysis indicates that the major initial effect of IFN is to block virion production or release, with blocking efficacies of 81, 95, and 96% for daily doses of 5, 10, and 15 million international units, respectively. The estimated virion half-life (t1/2) was, on average, 2.7 hours, with pretreatment production and clearance of 10(12) virions per day. The estimated infected cell death rate exhibited large interpatient variation (corresponding t1/2 = 1.7 to 70 days), was inversely correlated with baseline viral load, and was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels. Fast death rates were predictive of virus being undetectable by polymerase chain reaction at 3 months. These findings show that infection with hepatitis C virus is highly dynamic and that early monitoring of viral load can help guide therapy.     \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nHepatitis C viral dynamics in vivo and the antiviral efficacy of interferon-alpha therapy, Avidan U.

How such self-tolerance is achieved is still a subject of debate. The belief that autoimmunity poses a continuous threat to the organism was challenged by data demonstrating that autoimmunity has a protective function after traumatic injury to the central nervous system. This finding led us to suggest the 'comprehensive immunity' approach by which autoimmunity is viewed as a special case of immunity, namely as a defense mechanism that operates by fighting against the threat of potential destructive activity originated or mediated within the organism, similarly to the immune defense that operates against the threat from exogenous pathogens. We present a primary mathematical spatio-temporal model that supports this concept. The numerical solutions of this model illustrate the beneficial operation of a well-controlled immune response specific to self-antigens residing in the site of lesion. The model also explains how the response to self might be tolerated on a day-to-day basis. In addition, we demonstrate that the same autoimmune response, operating at different levels of regulation, can lead to either an autoimmune disease or a degenerative disorder. This preliminary qualitative model supports our contention that the way autoimmunity is perceived should be revised.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAutoimmunity as an immune defense against degenerative processes: a primary mathematical model illustrating the bright side of autoimmunity, Uri Nevo, Ido Golding, Avidan U.

In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca2+]i transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+ sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.\n\n\nThe original publication reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Quantitative Analysis of Cardiac Myocyte Relaxation: A Simulation Study, Steven Niederer, Peter Hunter, Nicholas Smith, 2006 \n            Biophysical Journal, 90 1697-1722  PubMed ID: 16339881\n",

We performed simulations in the presence of stretch-dependent increases in flux through the Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (AE), stretch-activated channels (SAC), and the stretch-dependent nitric oxide (NO) induced increased open probability of the ryanodine receptors to estimate the capacity of each mechanism to produce the slow force response (SFR). Inclusion of stretch-dependent NHE & AE, SACs, and stretch-dependent NO effects caused an increase in tension following 15 min of stretch of 0.87%, 32%, and 0%, respectively. Comparing [Ca2+]i dynamics before and after stretch in the presence of combinations of the three stretch-dependent elements, which produced significant SFR values (>20%), showed that the inclusion of stretch-dependent NO effects produced [Ca2+]i transients, which were not consistent with experimental results. Further simulations showed that in the presence of SACs and the absence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE inhibition of NHE attenuated the SFR, such that reduced SFR in the presence of NHE blockers does not indicate a stretch dependence of NHE. Rather, a functioning NHE is responsible for a portion of the SFR. Based on our simulations we estimate that in rat cardiac myocytes at room temperature SACs play a significant role in producing the SFR, potentially in the presence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE and that NO effects, if any, must involve more mechanisms than just increasing the open probability of ryanodine receptors.\n\n\nThe complete original publication reference is cited below:\n\nA mathematical model of the slow force response to stretch in rat ventricular myocytes, Steven Niederer, Nicholas Smith, 2007.\n            Biophysical Journal, 92 (11) 4030-4044, PubMed ID: 17369410\n",

The units have been checked and they are consistent. \n\nModel Structure\n\nIn 1962, Denis Noble published one of the first mathematical models of a cardiac cell.  By adapting the equations of the original Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon model (1952), Noble described the long lasting action and pace-maker potentials of the Purkinje fibres of the heart.  The potassium-current equations differ from those of Hodgkin and Huxley in that the potassium ions are assumed to flow through two types of channel in the membrane.  By contrast, the sodium current equations are very similar to those of Hodgkin and Huxley.\n\n\nThe main failure of the Noble (1962) model is that it only includes one voltage gated inward current, INa.  Calcium currents had not yet been discovered, but there was a clue in the model that something was missing.  The only way the model could be made to work was to greatly extend the voltage range of the sodium current by reducing the voltage dependence of the sodium activation process.  In effect the sodium current was made to serve the function of both the sodium and the calcium channels as far as the plateau is concerned.  There was a clear experimental prediction: either sodium channels in the heart are quantitatively different from those in neurons, or other inward current-carrying channels must exist.  Both predictions are correct.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Modification of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Applicable to Purkinje Fibre Action and Pace-maker Potentials, Noble, D. 1962 \n            Journal of Physiology\n          , 160, 317-352.

        "description": "Model Status\n\nThis model has been curated and unit-checked by Penny Noble of Oxford University and supports simulation of multiple action potentials. This model is known to run in COR and OpenCell.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nIntroduction: The idea that sodium-calcium exchange might generate a current during cardiac electrical activity was first raised as a possible mechanism for the pathological situation when calcium-overloaded tissue generates the transient inward current responsible for ectopic beating. This was one of the mechanisms proposed by Kass, Lederer, Tsien,\nand Weingart in 1978. Mullins had already suggested on theoretical grounds that a variety of currents flowing across the cardiac cell membrane might be carried by sodium-calcium exchange. With regard to the transient inward current, the evidence that it is carried mostly (though not entirely) by sodium-calcium exchange is now very strong in ventricular cells,4 and it has proved possible to reproduce this mechanism in computer models of cardiac electrical activity. The purpose of the present paper is to review the evidence, experimental and theoretical, for a major role of the sodium-calcium exchange current during normal cardiac rhythm. \n\n\nBrown et al. and Arlock and Noble recorded slow components of inward current following the calcium current that were attributed to sodium-calcium exchange activated by the intracellular calcium transient, while Mitchell et al. and Schouten and ter Keurs showed that the exchange current could play a major role in maintaining the late low plateau in rat ventricular cells. Several years previously Simurda et al. showed that a component of inward current during weak depolarizations is directly proportional to contractile force, suggesting that it was calcium activated.\n \n\nUntil 1987 it has to be admitted that these explanations were always subject to the criticism that the currents concerned were measured in highly complex situations with many other current components also present. Of course, if the role of sodium-calcium exchange during normal cellular activity is to be assessed, such experiments are necessary,\nand we will describe more of them later in this paper. But they need to be backed up by experiments done under conditions where the exchange current is isolated from other components. This was first achieved by Kimura, Miyamae, and Noma in 1987. The results were very relevant indeed, not only because they showed the electrogenic\nnature of the sodium-calcium exchange in cardiac cells (including demonstrating that\nits most likely stoichiometry was 3 : 1) but also because the current-voltage relations\nobtained were very similar to those required theoretically in modeling work to explain the results obtained in normal beating cardiac tissue.\n \n\nIt is no longer necessary, therefore, to prove the hypothesis that sodium-calcium exchange contributes a significant electric current. The question now is rather a functional one: How large can this current be and can it be sufficient to be primarily responsible for maintaining calcium balance in the heart by generating the major\ncomponent of calcium efflux? This is the hypothesis that led to the experimental and\nmodeling work done by Hilgemann and Noble. In this paper, we will describe experiments done on atrial and ventricular cells that attempt to refine this hypothesis. We will raise the question of how the contribution of\nsodium-calcium exchange to the action potential varies with the region of the heart from which the cells come, with the ionic concentration levels (in particular of internal ion concentrations) and with inotropic state.\n \n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nThe Role of Sodium-Calcium Exchange During the Cardiac Action Potential, by Noble D, Noble SJ, Bett GC, Earm YE, Ho WK, So IK, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1991;639:334-53.\n\t\t\t\tPubMed ID: 1785860 \n",

The calcium in this space is also assumed to play the major role in calcium-induced inactivation of the calcium current. Delayed potassium current equations have been developed to include the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed rectifier current based on the data of of Heath and Terrar, along with data from Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz. Length- and tension-dependent changes in mechanical and electrophysiological processes have been incorporated as described recently by Kohl et al. Drug receptor interactions have started to be developed, using the sodium channel as the first target. The new model has been tested against experimental data on action potential clamp, and on force-interval and duration-interval relations; it has been found to reliably reproduce experimental observations.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nImproved guinea-pig ventricular cell model incorporating a diadic space, IKr and IKs, and length- and tension-dependent processes, Denis Noble, Anthony Varghese, Peter Kohl and Penelope Noble, 1998, Can J Cardiol, 14, 123-134.

In order to reproduce the figures in the published paper, initial concentrations for the variables need to be obtained from the author, as they are not listed in the paper. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nDuring mitotic cell division, eukaryotic cells will replicate their DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, and then divide during the M-phase (see \n    the figure\n   below).  S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, G1 and G2 phases.  These discrete phases of the cell cycle are carefully regulated by specific proteins, and in most eukaryotic cells, cell cycle events are coordinated at three checkpoints:\n\nIn G1 phase, cells analyse both their external environment and their intracellular state before committing to a new cycle of DNA synthesis and division.\nIn the G2 phase, the cell checks that DNA synthesis and repair are complete, and that the cell has reached a critical size before mitosis is initiated.\nThirdly, at metaphase, the cell ensures that all chromosomes are correctly aligned on the central plate before they are separated to opposite poles of the spindle.\n\nOver the past few years advances in molecular genetics have lead to the elucidation of many of the molecular details of these control mechanisms.  But although cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are known to trigger the major events of the cell cycle, the precise mechanisms of the checkpoint controls are still uncertain.\n\n\nConcurrent with advances in experimental techniques and the generation of molecular data, mathematical models of increasing complexity have evolved.  In the study described here, Novak et al. develop a mathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1/S, G2/M and metaphase/anaphase transitions (see \n    the figure\n   below).  Much is known about the physiology, genetics and molecular biology of the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe).  By varying the parameter values of their model, the authors were able to represent both wild-type and wee1-\n mutant cells.  They found that their model was consistent with the observed phenotypes of many different mutant fission yeast strains, and it also was able to predict interesting phenotypes for some multiple-mutant strains that have not yet been constructed and analysed.  \n\n-\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1/S, G2/M and metaphase/anaphase transitions, Bela Novak, Attila Csikasz-Nagy, Bela Gyorffy, Kathy Chen, and John J.

Can these molecular components be spun together into a consistent mechanism that accounts for the observed behavior of growth and division in fission yeast cells? To answer this question, we propose a mechanism for the control system, convert it into a set of 14 differential and algebraic equations, study these equations by numerical simulation and bifurcation theory, and compare our results to the physiology of wild-type and mutant cells. In wild-type cells, progress through the cell cycle (G1-->S-->G2-->M) is related to cyclic progression around a hysteresis loop, driven by cell growth and chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate. However, the control system operates much differently in double-mutant cells, wee1(-) cdc25Delta, which are defective in progress through the latter half of the cell cycle (G2 and M phases). These cells exhibit \"quantized\" cycles (interdivision times clustering around 90, 160, and 230 min). We show that these quantized cycles are associated with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the mechanism, when the wee1 and cdc25 genes are disabled.

Strict controls normally operate to prevent repeated rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitoses (\"endoreplication\") or initiation of mitosis before DNA is fully replicated (\"mitotic catastrophe\"). Some of the genetic interactions involved in these controls have recently been identified in yeast. From this evidence we propose a molecular mechanism of \"Start\" control in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using established principles of biochemical kinetics, we compare the properties of this model in detail with the observed behavior of various mutant strains of fission yeast: wee1(-) (size control at Start), cdc13Delta and rum1(OP) (endoreplication), and wee1(-) rum1Delta (rapid division cycles of diminishing cell size). We discuss essential features of the mechanism that are responsible for characteristic properties of Start control in fission yeast, to expose our proposal to crucial experimental tests.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the control of DNA replication in fission yeast, Bela Novak and John J.

If cycloheximide is later removed\nfrom the culture medium, treated cells will return to the division cycle, showing a complex pattern of division times post-treatment,\nas first measured by Zetterberg and colleagues.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nWe simulate these physiological responses of mammalian cells to transient inhibition\nof growth, using a set of nonlinear differential equations based on a realistic model of the molecular events underlying progression\nthrough the cell cycle. The model relieson our earlier work on the regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases during the cell\ndivision cycle of yeast. The yeast model is supplemented with equations describing the effects of retinoblastoma protein on cell\ngrowth and the synthesis of cyclins A and E, and with a primitive representation of the signaling pathway that controls synthesis of\ncyclin D.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA model for restriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle, Bela Novak, and John J Tyson, 2004, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tJournal of Theoretical Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t, 230, 563-579.

(1997)] of the G1-phase of the cell cycle is presented. This model describes the regulation of the G1-phase that includes the interactions of the nuclear proteins, RB, cyclin E, cyclin D, cdk2, cdk4 and E2F. The effects of the growth factors on cyclin D synthesis under saturated or unsaturated growth factor conditions are investigated based on this model. The solutions to this model (a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations) are discussed with respect to existing experiments. Predictions based on mathematical analysis of this model are presented. In particular, results are presented on the existence of two stablesolutions, i.e., bistability within the G1-phase. It is shown that this bistability exists under unsaturated growth factor concentration levels. This phenomenon is very noticeable if the efficiency of the signal transduction, initiated by the growth factors leading to cyclin D synthesis, is low. The biological significance of this result as well as possible experimental designs to test these predictions are presented.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA model of cell cycle behavior dominated by kinetics of a pathway stimulated by growth factors, Mandri N.

It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMechanism of protection of peroxidase activity by oscillatory dynamics, Lars F.

The b model does not exactly recreate published results\nModel Structure\n\nMany different agonists use calcium as a second messenger. Despite intensive research in intracellular calcium signalling it is an unsolved riddle how the different types of information represented by the different agonists, is encoded using the universal carrier calcium. It is also still not clear how the information encoded is decoded again into the intracellular specific information at the site of enzymes and genes. After the discovery of calcium oscillations, one likely mechanism is that information is encoded in the frequency, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. This hypothesis has received some experimental support. However, the mechanism of decoding of oscillatory signals is still not known. Here, we study a mechanistic model of calcium oscillations, which is able to reproduce both spiking and bursting calcium oscillations. We use the model to study the decoding of calcium signals on the basis of co-operativity of calcium binding to various proteins. We show that this co-operativity offers a simple way to decode different calcium dynamics into different enzyme activities.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nOn the encoding and decoding of calcium signals in hepatocytes, Ann Zahle Larsen, Lars Folke Olsen, Ursula Kummer, 2004 Biophysical Chemistry, 107, 83-89.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAstrocytic mechanisms explaining neural-activity-induced shrinkage of extraneuronal space, Ostby I, Oyehaug L, Einevoll GT, Nagelhus EA, Plahte E, Zeuthen T, Lloyd CM, Ottersen OP, and Omholt SW, 2009, PLoS Computational Biology, 5, 1, e1000272.

All the units are balanced.  Note that this model will not run in COR due to the presence of a \"remainder\" function.  Note there are no figures in the paper showing the simuation results of this model.  However we can say that the simulation output from the CellML model looks reasonable - the body temperature and metabolic rates have physiologically realistic values and oscillate over a 24 hour period according to day and night changes.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: PURPOSE: To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of recombinant human interleukin-21 (IL-21) on core body temperature in cynomolgus monkeys using basic mechanisms of heat regulation. A major effort was devoted to compare the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. METHODS: A temperature model was formulated including circadian rhythm, metabolism, heat loss, and a thermoregulatory set-point. This model was formulated as a mixed-effects model based on SDEs using NONMEM. RESULTS: The effects of IL-21 were on the set-point and the circadian rhythm of metabolism. The model was able to describe a complex set of IL-21 induced phenomena, including 1) disappearance of the circadian rhythm, 2) no effect after first dose, and 3) high variability after second dose. SDEs provided a more realistic description with improved simulation properties, and further changed the model into one that could not be falsified by the autocorrelation function. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-21 induced effects on thermoregulation in cynomolgus monkeys are explained by a biologically plausible model. The quality of the model was improved by the use of SDEs.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nPKPD model of interleukin-21 effects on thermoregulation in monkeys - application and evaluation of stochastic differential equations, Rune Viig Overgaard, Nick Holford, Klaus A.

Under many different conditions, the rate limiting event of cell migration is the rate at which the cell and the substratum detach at the cell rear.  \n\n\nIn order to invetigate this cellular process further, Palecek et al. have devloped a mathematical model to integrate how the biophysical and biochemical interactions between integrins, the cytoskelton, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) affect rear retraction and linkage dissociation mechanisms (see the figure below).  The model also examines how applied forces and integrin clustering affect retracion kinetics, and it predicts two distinct phenotypes.  In the first, detachment is rapid, dominated by integrin-ECM dissociation, and it occurs at high forces or low adhesiveness.  In the second phenotype, detachment is slower, and it occurs at low forces or high adhesiveness.  The model also helps to explain why some cell types, such as leukocytes or keratocytes, are able to detach easily and move quickly while other cell types, such as fibroblasts, migrate more slowly and release more integrins during detachment.      \n\n\nBecause the parameters for the attachment and detachment phases of the model are given the same identifiers, the model in the CellML format has been divided into two separate models, one for attachment and the other for the detachment phase.     \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nKinetic Model for Integrin-mediated Adhesion Release During Cell Migration, Sean P.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n          This cell model was developed by Liren Li and represents the mouse ventricular myocyte. It reads both in OpenCell and COR and is able to produce action potentials under multiple stimuli.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nThe transgenic mouse has become an important new tool in the study of human diseases and the design of new therapies. With increasing genetic manipulations applied to the mice, it is important to characterise and understand the electrical and biophysical properties of the ionic currents expressed in the mouse heart. A computational model of the mouse action potentials, based on experimental measurements and findings, has been developed to help explore the complexities of the cardiac electrophysiology. \n\n\nThe mouse ventricular myocyte model is a modification from the Pandit rat LV epicardial cell model. The rat LV epicardial model was first modified to match experimental recordings from rat RV cells. The RV model was then used as the control model for the development of the mouse model. To summarise, from the original rat LV epicardial model, the following modifications have been made:\n\n\nINa\n: The conductance of the sodium channel was increased by 33% compared with that for the rat LV epicardium (control model), to match experimental findings of higher expression of this channel in RV myocytes. And this higher conductance value was carried onto the mouse model.\n\n\nICaL\n: The conductance of ICaL was increased by 10%, so that the influx of Ca2+ ions via ICaL (QCaL), and the APD90 value during a simulated RV action potential were comparable to corresponding experimental measurements in rat RV myocytes. And this was carried onto the mouse model.\n\n2+\n\nIt\n: The formulation for It in the rat LV epicardial model had three gating variables. They are one activation variable (r) and two inactivation variables, i.e. fat (s) and slow (sslow) inactivation variables. But the formulation for It in the mouse model only contains one activation variable (r) and one inactivation variable (s). \n\n\nIss\n: In the rat LV epicardial cells, the steady-state outward K+ current (Iss) is characterized as a rapidly activating, very slowly inactivating current. The model contains both an activation variable (rss) and an inactivation variable (sss). However, in the mouse model, the inactivation variable has been removed, and the channel is only gated by rss.\n\n\nIkslow\n: This additional current arises in the mouse model as a result of experimental findings that the outward current of adult mouse ventricular myocytes have an incomplete inactivation phase characterized by a sum of a pedestal and two exponentials with a fast time constant similar to that of classic Ito and a slow time constant. It is believed that this additional current in mouse is a main factor contributing to the faster rate of repolarization seen in mouse compared to rats.\n\n\nThe original paper references are cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Model of Action Potential Heterogeneity in Adult Rat Left Ventricular Myocytes, Sandeep V.

(1992) J. Membrane Biol. 125:49-62) were evaluated in terms of a kinetic model. The steady-state and presteady-state cotransporter properties are described by a 6-state ordered kinetic model (\"mirror\" symmetry) with a Na:aMDG stoichiometry of 2. Carrier translocation in the membrane as well as Na and sugar binding and dissociation are treated as a function of their individual rate constants. Empty carrier translocation and Na binding/dissociation are the only steps considered to be voltage dependent. Currents were associated with the translocation of the negatively charged carrier in the membrane. Negative membrane potential facilitates sugar transport. One numerical solution was found for the 14 rate constants that account quantitatively for our experiment observations: i.e., (i) sigmoidal shape of the sugar-specific current-voltage curves (absence of outward currents and inward current saturation at high negative potentials), (ii) Na and voltage dependence of K_0.5_sugar and i_max_sugar , (iii) sugar and voltage dependence of K_0.5_Na and i_max_Na, (iv) presteady-state currents and their dependence on external Na, aMDG and membrane potential, and (v) and carrier Na leak current. We conclude that the main voltage effect is on carrier translocation. Na ions that migrate from the extracellular medium to their binding sites sense 25 to 35% of the transmembrane voltage, whereas charges associated with the carrier translocation experiences 60 to 75% of the membrane electrical field. Internal Na ion binding is not voltage dependent. In our nonrapid equilibrium model, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is a function of the membrane potential, [Na]o and [aMDG]o. At 0 mV and at saturating [Na]o and [aMDG]o, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is the empty carrier translocation (5 sec-1). As the membrane potential is made more negative, the empty carrier translocation gets faster and the internal Na dissociation becomes increasingly rate limiting. However, as [Na]o is decreased to less than 10 mM, the ratelimiting step is the external Na ions binding in the 0 to -150 mV potential range. At 0 mV, the external Na dissociation constant KNa' is 80 mM and decreases to 24 mM at -150 mV. The external sugar dissociation constant KNaS' is estimated to be 200 microM and voltage independent. Finally, the internal leak pathway (CNa2 translocation) is insignificant. While we cannot rule out a more complex kinetic model, the electrical properties of the cloned Na/glucose cotransporter are found to be adequately described by this 6-state kinetic model.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElectrogenic Properties of the Cloned Na+/Glucose Cotransporter: II.

To explore the possible role of this system in the physiological modulation of electrical and contractile activity, we have developed a mathematical model of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in which the TATS is described as a single compartment. The geometrical characteristics of the TATS, the biophysical characteristics of ion transporters and their distribution between surface and tubular membranes were based on available experimental data. Biophysically realistic values of mean access resistance to the tubular lumen and time constants for ion exchange with the bulk extracellular solution were included. The fraction of membrane in the TATS was set to 56%. The action potentials initiated in current-clamp mode are accompanied by transient K+ accumulation and transient Ca2+ depletion in the TATS lumen. The amplitude of these changes relative to external ion concentrations was studied at steady-state stimulation frequencies of 1-5Hz. Ca2+ depletion increased from 7 to 13.1% with stimulation frequency, while K+ accumulation decreased from 4.1 to 2.7%. These ionic changes (particularly Ca2+ depletion) implicated significant decrease of intracellular Ca2+ load at frequencies natural for rat heart.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe functional role of cardiac T-tubules explored in a model of rat ventricular myocytes, Michal Pasek, Jiri Simurda, and Georges Christe, 2006, Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A, 81, 3029-3051.

The model reproduces frequency-dependent changes of action potential shape and intracellular ion concentrations and can replicate experimental data showing ion diffusion between the tubular lumen and external solution in guinea-pig myocytes. The model is stable at rest and during activity and returns to rested state after perturbation. Theoretical analysis and model simulations show that, due to tight electrical coupling, tubular and surface membranes behave as a homogeneous whole during voltage and current clamp (maximum difference 0.9 mV at peak tubular INa of -38 nA). However, during action potentials, restricted diffusion and ionic currents in TATS cause depletion of tubular Ca2+ and accumulation of tubular K+ (up to -19.8% and +3.4%, respectively, of bulk extracellular values, at 6 Hz). These changes, in turn, decrease ion fluxes across the TATS membrane and decrease sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load.

To observe an overall oscillatory insulin profile it is necessary that the insulin secretion from individual beta-cells is synchronized within islets, and that the population of islets is also synchronized. We have recently developed a model in which pulsatile insulin secretion is produced as a result of calcium-driven electrical oscillations in combination with oscillations in glycolysis. We use this model to investigate possible mechanisms for intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization. We show that electrical coupling is sufficient to synchronize both electrical bursting activity and metabolic oscillations. We also demonstrate that islets can synchronize by mutually entraining each other by their effects on a simple model \"liver,\" which responds to the level of insulin secretion by adjusting the blood glucose concentration in an appropriate way. Since all islets are exposed to the blood, the distributed islet-liver system can synchronize the individual islet insulin oscillations. Thus, we demonstrate how intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization of insulin oscillations may be achieved.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nIntra- and inter-islet synchronization of metabolically driven insulin secretion, Morten Gram Pedersen, Richard Bertram, and Arthur Sherman, 2005,Biophysical Journal\n\t\t\t\t\t, 89, 107-119.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis model has been built with the differential expressions in Perelson, Kirschner and de Boer's 1993 paper for the 1st model (perelson_1993a); where HIV does not infect precursor T-cell and thus rate of supply of CD4+ T cells from the precursors (parameter s) remains constant. This file is known to run in OpenCell and COR, and is set to the parameters in Table 1 of the paper. By changing the the parameters, the model will replicate all panels in figures 2 to 8. Note that in the paper, some figure diagrams are scaled logarithmically.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: We examine a model for the interaction of HIV with CD4+ T cells that considers four populations: uninfected T cells, latently infected T cells, actively infected T cells, and free virus. Using this model we show that many of the puzzling quantitative features of HIV infection can be explained simply. We also consider effects of AZT on viral growth and T-cell population dynamics. The model exhibits two steady states, an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected state, in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if N, the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T cell, is less a critical value, Ncrit, then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative orthant, and this state is stable. For N > Ncrit, the uninfected state is unstable, and the endemically infected state can be either stable, or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is stable, it is characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment of this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T cells, during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows exponentially, and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation the model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in the model. The model predicts that different viral strains, characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T cells, can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate depletion at different rates. Two versions of the model are studied. In one the source of T cells from precursors is constant, whereas in the other the source of T cells decreases with viral load, mimicking the infection and killing of T-cell precursors. The latter gives more realistic predictions than the model with a constant source.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nDynamics of HIV infection of CD4+ T cells, Perelson, Kirschner, Boer, Mathematical Biosciences, 114, 81-125.

The model runs in both COR and PCEnv, the units have been checked and they are consistent. The simulation output from the CellML model looks reasonable, however we were unable to check it against the original model results as the paper does not contain any simulation graphs. Please note that the value of the initial condition of T_star and the parameters k and N were not definied in the paper so these have been set to 0, 2.4e-5, and 774 respectively, according to the values which were defined in Perelson et al. 1993.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: A new mathematical model was used to analyze a detailed set of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) viral load data collected from five infected individuals after the administration of a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nHIV-1 dynamics in vivo: virion clearance rate, infected cell life-span, and viral generation time, Alan S.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n\nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes 'flip-flop' behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distinguishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA quantitative model of sleep-wake dynamics based on the physiology of the brainstem ascending arousal system, A.J.K.

It runs in both PCEnv and COR to replicate figure 2 in the paper (using the old nominal values from table one).  The units have been checked and they are consistent.  Note that the model has to be run for at least 3 cycles for it to stabilse into steady oscillations.\n\nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: A physiologically based quantitative model of the human ascending arousal system is used to study sleep deprivation after being calibrated on a small set of experimentally based criteria. The model includes the sleep-wake switch of mutual inhibition between nuclei which use monoaminergic neuromodulators, and the ventrolateral preoptic area. The system is driven by the circadian rhythm and sleep homeostasis. We use a small number of experimentally derived criteria to calibrate the model for sleep deprivation, then investigate model predictions for other experiments, demonstrating the scope of application. Calibration gives an improved parameter set, in which the form of the homeostatic drive is better constrained, and its weighting relative to the circadian drive is increased. Within the newly constrained parameter ranges, the model predicts repayment of sleep debt consistent with experiment in both quantity and distribution, asymptoting to a maximum repayment for very long deprivations. Recovery is found to depend on circadian phase, and the model predicts that it is most efficient to recover during normal sleeping phases of the circadian cycle, in terms of the amount of recovery sleep required. The form of the homeostatic drive suggests that periods of wake during recovery from sleep deprivation are phases of relative recovery, in the sense that the homeostatic drive continues to converge toward baseline levels. This undermines the concept of sleep debt, and is in agreement with experimentally restricted recovery protocols. Finally, we compare our model to the two-process model, and demonstrate the power of physiologically based modeling by correctly predicting sleep latency times following deprivation from experimental data.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSleep deprivation in a quantitative physiologically based model of the ascending arousal system, A.J.K.

This particular version of the model has an increased rate of osteoclast differentiation (D_OC_p) for the first 100 days, and the values for \"model 1\" have been taken from table 2 of the published paper. This CellML model translation was based on the author's original Matlab code and we would like to thank them for sharing this code with us.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: It is generally accepted that RANKL is highly expressed in osteoblast precursor cells while OPG is highly expressed in mature osteoblasts, but to date no functional utility to the BMU has been proposed for this particular ligand-decoy-receptor expression profile. As discovered in the mid 90s, the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling cascade is a major signaling pathway regulating bone remodeling. In this paper we study theoretically the functional implications of particular RANKL/OPG expression profiles on bone volume. For this purpose we formulate an extended bone-cell dynamics model describing functional behaviour of basic multicellular units (BMUs) responsible for bone resorption and formation. This model incorporates the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling together with the regulating action of TGF-beta on bone cells. The bone-cell population model employed here builds on the work of Lemaire et al. (2004) [1], but incorporates the following significant modifications: (i) addition of a rate equation describing changes in bone volume with time as the key 'output function' tracking functional behaviour of BMUs, (ii) a rate equation describing release of TGF-beta from the bone matrix, (iii) expression of OPG and RANKL on both osteoblastic cell lines, and (iv) modified activator/repressor functions. Using bone volume as a functional selection criterion, we find that there is a preferred arrangement for ligand expression on particular cell types, and further, that this arrangement coincides with biological observations. We then investigate the model parameter space combinatorially, searching for preferred 'groupings' of changes in differentiation rates of various cell types. Again, a criterion of bone volume change is employed to identify possible ways of optimally controlling BMU responses. While some combinations of changes in differentiation rates are clearly unrealistic, other combinations of changes in differentiation rates are potentially functionally significant. Most importantly, the combination of parameter changes representing the signaling pathway for TGF-beta gives a unique result that appears to have a clear biological rationale. The methodological approach for the investigation of model structure described here offers a theoretical explanation as to why TGF-beta has its particular suite of biological effects on bone-cell differentiation rates.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel structure and control of bone remodeling: a theoretical study, Pivonka P, Zimak J, Smith DW, Gardiner BS, Dunstan CR, Sims NA, Martin TJ, Mundy GR, 2008, Bone, 43, 249-263.

Experimental evidence indicates that this phenomenon is due to the interaction of multiple conductances with very different kinetics, and the model incorporates this evidence. As a parameter is varied the model undergoes a transition between two oscillatory waveforms; a corresponding transition is observed experimentally. After establishing the periodicity of the subcritical oscillatory solution, the nature of the transition is studied. It is found to be a resonance bifurcation, with the solution branching at the critical point to another periodic solution of the same period. Using this result a comparison is made between the model and experimental observations. The model is found to predict and allow an interpretation of these observations.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nBifurcation and resonance in a model for bursting nerve cells, R.E.

The model runs in COR and Opencell to it recreate the published results. This model recreates continuous PTH dosing model using low doses.\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) kinetics, focusing on the receptor's response to PTH dosing to discern bone formation responses from bone resorption. The PTH1R is a major target for new osteoporosis treatments, as pulsatile PTH dosing has been shown to induce net bone formation in both animals and humans, and PTH(1-34) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. PTH has also been shown to cause net bone loss when given continuously, so that the net action of PTH on bone is dependent on the dosing pattern. We have developed a simplified two-state receptor kinetics model for the PTH1R, based on the concepts of Segel et al., to distinguish the activity of active and inactive receptor and receptor-ligand complexes. The goal is to develop a plausible model of the minimal essential biological relationships necessary for understanding the responses to PTH dosing. A two-state model is able to effectively discriminate between continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing using the active species as surrogates for the downstream anabolic response. For continuous PTH dosing, the model predicts a desensitized system dominated by the inactive receptor and complex, consistent with downstream net bone loss that has been demonstrated experimentally. Using pulsatile PTH dosing, the model system predicts a highly sensitized state dominated by the active receptor and complex, corresponding to net bone formation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinetics of the receptor plays a critical role in the downstream effects of PTH dosing. Moreover, these results indicate that within a range of biologically relevant PTH doses, the two-state model is able to capture the differential behavior of the system for both continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing. The development of such a model provides a rational basis for developing more biologically extensive models that may support the design of optimal dosing strategies for PTH-based anti-osteoporosis treatments. Moreover, this model provides a unique starting point from which to design experiments investigating PTH receptor biology.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nResponse to continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing: a mathematical model for parathyroid hormone receptor kinetics, Laura K.

Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical androgenic and antiandrogenic compounds. A mathematical model for the dynamics of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson (1997). The model describes the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone (T), 5{alpha}-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and luteinizing hormone (LH), with metabolism of T to DHT by 5{alpha}-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by LH and negative regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes involved in prostate size and function include cell proliferation, apoptosis, fluid production, and 5{alpha}-reductase activity. Each process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for intact, castrated, and intravenous T-injected rats. After calibration, the model accurately captures the castration-induced regression of the prostate compared with experimental data that show that the prostate regresses to ~17 and 5% of its intact weight at 14 and 30 days postcastration, respectively. The model also accurately predicts serum T and AR levels following castration compared with data. This model provides a framework for quantifying the kinetics and effects of environmental and pharmaceutical endocrine active compounds on the prostate.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical model for the androgenic regulation of the prostate in intact and castrated adult male rats, Laura K.

In the majority of these patients, sudden cardiac death is thought to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Alterations of the electric properties of single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present study, selected ionic currents based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action potential model developed by Luo and Rudy (LR model). The main results obtained from this model are as follows: The action potential in ventricular myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the slowed diastolic decay of the [Ca2+]i transient, and the reduction of the inwardly rectifying K+ current and the Na+-K+ pump current in myocytes of failing hearts. Furthermore, the fast and slow components of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr) and I(Ks), respectively) are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human ventricular action potential. In contrast, the influence of the transient outward K+ current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of I(Kr) promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in failing, but not nonfailing, myocytes. Furthermore, spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human ventricular myocardium.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSimulation study of cellular electric properties in heart failure, Leo Priebe and Dirk J.

The units have been checked and are consistent. This CellML description is deterministic, unlike the stochastic model created and preferred by the authors. A few equations are therefore different from the model in the Biomodels database, such as the rate equations describing the dimerisation of HSF1 and the aggregation of MisP, and the graphs produced have smooth curves since random fluctuations of the intracellular preocesses are not taken into account. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts after brief exposure\nof cells to elevated temperatures. They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent proteins, the re-folding of\ndenatured proteins, the prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and\nlysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced\ntranscription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock\nproteins resulting in feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to\nHSF, which is then able to become transcriptionally active.\n\n\n\t\t\tThe induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant/damaged proteins\naccumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and\ncataract). Therefore, the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing.

During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins.\nMany neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive\ninclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded,\nubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a\nsystems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity\nwith age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further\ninhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on.The model can be used to predict the\neffects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the\nenzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different\nconditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under\nconditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were\ndepleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish\nubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis\nof the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation\nkinetics.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAn in silico model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that incorporates normal homeostasis and age-related decline, Carole J.

An interactive computer program, LabHEART, was developed to simulate the action potential, ionic currents and Ca handling mechanisms in a rabbit ventricular myocyte.  Please click here to download the latest version of LabHeart.\n\n\nSince Hodgkin and Huxley published their mathematical model of the squid axon in 1952 several groups have extended this modelling to cardiac ionic currents and action potentials.  Ca also plays an essential role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, and the dynamic interplay between the action potential and Ca regulation mechanisms has come to be included in cardiac cell models.\n\n\nOf the many electrophysiological models, Luo and Rudy's dynamic model (1994) has perhaps become the standard, updated with modifications based on experimental data generated by other research groups (for example Zeng, Laurita, Rosenbaum and Rudy (1995), Shaw and Rudy (1997), Viswanathan, Shaw and Rudy (1999) and Faber and Rudy (2000)).  Jose Puglisi and Donald Bers adapted the equations from Luo and Rudy to rabbit ventricular myocytes using values obtained from the literature and from their own laboratory.  The main differences between this model and Luo-Rudy II is the inclusion of a transient outward K current (i_to) and Ca-activated Cl current (i_Cl_Ca), as well as altering the kinetics of the T-type Ca channel (i_Ca_T), the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K current (i_Kr) and the rescaling of several conductances to match results in the rabbit ventricle.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nLabHEART: an interactive computer model of rabbit ventricular myocyte ion channels and Ca transport, Jose L.

The model also reproduces the repetitive firing properties seen in neonatal HMs and replicates the neuron's response to pharmacological experiments. The model was used to study the role of specific ionic currents in HM firing and how variations in the densities of these currents may account for age-dependent changes in excitability seen in HMs. By varying the density of a fast inactivating calcium current, the model alternates between accelerating and adapting firing patterns. Modeling the age-dependent increase in H current density accounts for the decrease in mAHP duration observed experimentally, but does not fully account for the decrease in input resistance. An increase in the density of the voltage-dependent potassium currents and the H current is required to account for the decrease in input resistance. These changes also account for the age-dependent decrease in action potential duration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIonic current model of a hypoglossal motoneuron, Robert J.

The CellML model should be run for a duration of 20000 ms with a step size of 0.1 ms and a high point density of 100000 points/graph.  This model represents a single pacemaker cell.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: The pre-Botzinger complex (pBC) is a vital subcircuit of the respiratory central pattern generator. Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned, their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our previously developed pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and sparsely connected networks were explored for several levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with a low probability of bursting and low input and output ranges. The results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the network is greater than 20% of the population. Experimental tests of the model predictions are proposed.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIntrinsic Bursters Increase the Robustness of Rythm Generation in an Excitatory Network, L.K.

In our model, the positive feedback facilitated by CDC25 and wee1 causes bistability in cyclin-dependent kinase activity, whereas the negative feedback facilitated by SKP2 or anaphase-promoting-complex turns this bistable behavior into limit cycle behavior. The cell cycle checkpoint is a Hopf bifurcation point. These behaviors are coordinated by growth and division to maintain normal cell cycle and size homeostasis. This model successfully reproduces sizer, timer, and the restriction point features of the eukaryotic cell cycle, in addition to other experimental findings.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDynamics of the Cell Cycle: Checkpoints, Sizers, and Timers, Zhilin Qu, W.

Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDynamic rerouting of the carbohydrate flux is key to counteracting oxidative stress, Markus Ralser, Mirjam M Wamelink, Axel Kowald, Birgit Gerisch, Gino Heeren, Eduard A Struys, Edda Klipp, Cornelis Jakobs, Michael Breitenbach, Hans Lehrach and Sylvia Krobitsch, 2007, Journal of Biology, volume 6, 1-18.

To obtain insights into the ionic mechanisms governing canine atrial AP properties, we incorporated formulations of K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) currents, based on measurements in canine atrial myocytes, into a mathematical model of the AP. The rate-dependent behavior of model APs corresponded to experimental measurements and pointed to a central role for L-type Ca(2+) current inactivation in rate adaptation. Incorporating previously described regional ionic current variations into the model largely reproduced AP forms characteristic of the corresponding right atrial regions (appendage, pectinate muscle, crista terminalis, and atrioventricular ring). When ionic alterations induced by tachycardia-dependent remodeling were incorporated, the model reproduced qualitatively the AP features constituting the cellular substrate for atrial fibrillation. We conclude that this ionic model of the canine atrial AP agrees well with experimental measurements and gives potential insights into mechanisms underlying functionally important electrophysiological phenomena in canine atrium.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical analysis of canine atrial action potentials: rate, regional factors, and electrical remodeling, Rafael J.

This time delay factor has been ignored in this current CellML model.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: We present a mathematical model which includes TNF-alpha initiated survival and apoptotic cascades, as well as nuclear transcription of IkappaB. These pathways play a crucial role in deciding cell fate in response to inflammation and infection. Our model incorporates known specific protein-protein interactions as identified by experiments. Using these biochemical interactions, we develop a mathematical model of the NF-kappaB-mediated survival and caspase-mediated apoptosis pathways. Using mass action kinetics, we follow the formation of the survival and late complexes as well as the dynamics of DNA fragmentation. The effect of TNF-alpha concentration on DNA fragmentation is modeled and compares well with experiment. Nuclear transcription is also modeled phenomenologically by means of time lagged cytosolic concentrations. This results in transcription related concentrations undergoing under-damped oscillations, in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment. Using a tumor cell as a hypothetical model, we explore the interplay between the components of the survival and apoptotic pathways. Results are presented which make predictions on the limits of cellular oscillations in terms of time delay, initial concentration ratios and other features of the model. The model also makes clear predictions on cell viability in terms of DNA damage within the framework of TNF-alpha stimulus duration.\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n  Survival and Apoptotic Pathways Initiated by TNF-alpha: Modeling and Predictions.

The units have been checked and they are consistent. Several parameter values were missing from the model description in the original paper. Where a value for a variable is unknown it has been defined as 1.000 in this CellML model (these added values are distinct from any value which is definitely known to be 1 by including 3 decimal places). \t\t\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A mathematical model of calcium homeostasis is presented in which the controlling factors are the plasma concentrations of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol, and the effector organs are the parathyroids, bone, kidney, and intestine. Other factors can be added as the need arises. The model is aimed at simulating what happens in a single individual, but its parameters and variables were adjusted to the corresponding published average values. Simulations of published observations in humans undergoing the infusion of calcium or its chelators are presented. With a single exception, these simulations provided a good fit to the data. The response of the system to extrinsic perturbations was characterized by simulating chronic infusions of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol. Finally, the steady state response to perturbations in some of its parameters (the secretory mass of the parathyroids and the affinity and/or sensitivity of the calcium, PTH, and calcitriol receptors) and to renal failure were also investigated in an attempt to analyze the pathogenesis of clinical hypo- or hypercalcemias. In its present form the model cannot be used to base clinical decisions in individual cases. However, it requires modest computational resources, and clinicians with a modest mathematical background can manipulate it. It is a useful tool for the analysis of general mechanisms of the diseases of calcium metabolism and for the design of clinical experiments aimed at characterizing these diseases. The model can also be the core of future autoadaptive extensions to be used in individual patients.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA minimal mathematical model of calcium homeostasis, Raposo JF, Sobrinho LG, Ferreira HG, 2002, The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 87, 4330-4340.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        This CellML model represents the second model from the published paper (eqs 35-37). This model builds on the core model (which describes changes in the concentration of PTH, the number of osteoclasts and the number of osteoblasts) by considering the effects of exogenous PTH administration - in this particular case pulsatile, for a period of 6 hours in an interval of 1 day. The model runs in OpenCell to recreate the published results (figure 6b). The units are all dimensionless (in accordance with the published paper) and are therefore consistent. However a dimensionless time does mean that the model will not run in COR.  \n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Bone, a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics, which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this nonlinear remodeling process. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling of bone formation and resorption mediated by parathyroid hormone: response to estrogen/PTH therapy, Chontita Rattanakul, Yongwimon Lenbury, Nateetip Krishnamara, and David J.

It is not yet an accurate match for the experimental results.   \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: A relatively simple method is presented for incorporating cross-bridge mechanisms into a muscle model. The method is based on representing force in a half sarcomere as the product of the stiffness of all parallel cross bridges and their average distortion. Differential equations for sarcomeric stiffness are derived from a three-state kinetic scheme for the cross-bridge cycle. Differential equations for average distortion are derived from a distortional balance that accounts for distortion entering and leaving due to cross-bridge cycling and for distortion imposed by shearing motion between thick and thin filaments. The distortion equations are unique and enable sarcomere mechanodynamics to be described by only a few ordinary differential equations. Model predictions of small-amplitude step and sinusoidal responses agreed well with previously described experimental results and allowed unique interpretations to be made of various response components. Similarly good results were obtained for model reproductions of force-velocity and large-amplitude step and ramp responses. The model allowed reasonable predictions of contractile behavior by taking into account what is understood to be basic muscle contractile mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\t\t\tStiffness-distortion sacromere model for muscle stimulation, Maria V.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model runs in PCEnv and COR to recreate the published results. As described in the paper, this model simulates isometric conditions and has parameters for v,w, and u set to 1. This is the condition for no cooperativity, but changing these values allows for differing degrees of cooperativity. Ca activation is maximized, to mimic Table 2 in the paper.   \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: Cooperativity in contractile behavior of myofilament systems almost assuredly arises because of interactions between neighboring sites. These interactions may be of different kinds. Tropomyosin thin-filament regulatory units may have neighbors in steric blocking positions (off) or steric permissive positions (on). The position of these neighbors influence the tendency for the regulatory unit to assume the on or off state. Likewise, the tendency of a myosin cross-bridge to achieve a force-bearing state may be influenced by whether neighboring cross-bridges are in force-bearing states. Also, a cross-bridge in the force-bearing state may influence the tendency of a regulatory unit to enter the on state. We used a mathematical model to examine the influence of each of these three kinds of neighbor interactions on the steady-state force-pCa relation and on the dynamic force redevelopment process. Each neighbor interaction was unique in its effects on maximal Ca2+-activated force, position, and symmetry of the force-pCa curve and on the Hill coefficient. Also, each neighbor interaction had a distinctive effect on the time course of force development as assessed by its rate coefficient, kdev. These diverse effects suggest that variations in all three kinds of nearest-neighbor interactions may be responsible for a wide variety of currently unexplained observations of myofilament contractile behavior..\n\n\n\nDifferent Myofilament Nearest-Neighbor Interactions Have Distinctive Effects on Contractile Behavior Maria V.

(2000), a mathematical model is developed for the methionine cycle. A large amount of information is available about the enzymes that catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine, and the removal of mass from the cycle by the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational \"experiments\" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA mathematical model of the methionine cycle, Michael C.

It recreates the published results, and is currently set up for a dual pulse experiment, with duration of 100 milliseconds. The model is relatively stiff, so maximum step size and number of steps might have to be adjusted to obtain discernible changes.  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: We present a mathematical model for calcium oscillations in the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons. The underlying mechanism is based on direct negative regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by calcium/calmodulin and does not require any autocatalysis such as calcium-induced calcium release. The model is in quantitative agreement with available experimental data, both with respect to oscillations and to fast adaptation. We give predictions for the ranges of parameters in which oscillations should be observable. Relevance of the model to calcium oscillations in other systems is discussed.   \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModel of Calcium Oscillations Due to Negative Feedback in Olfactory Cilia, J.

        "description": "Model Status\nThis model has been built with the differential expressions in Revilla and Garcia-Ramos' 2003 paper for a dynamic model for HIV-1 therapy. This file is known to run in OpenCell to reproduce all panels in figure 2. The units have been checked and they are consistent. The initial conditions [x, y, z, v, w] can be altered to replicate the different panels [single infected system (a): x=200, y=0, z=0, v=10^-6, w=0], [system with double infection (b): x=3, y=6, z=0, v=149, w=1], [alternate system with double infection (c): same as b, but alpha=0.016], and current parameterization is set to replicate figure2b. Note that in the paper, the figure diagrams are scaled logarithmically.  Note that the model also runs in COR, but due to the unit of time being days, the timescale is a problem for the CellML model simulation to recreate the published model results.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nFighting a virus with a virus: a dynamic model for HIV-1 therapy, Tomas Revilla and Gisela Garcia-Ramos, 2003, Mathematical Biosciences, 185, 191-203.

Two phenomena that characterise these short-term I-F relations are restitution and postextrasystolic potentiation.  In their 2000 paper, J. Jeremy Rice, M. Saleet Jafri and Raimond L. Winslow use two modelling approaches to study short-term interval-force relations in cardiac muscle.  Their first approach employs a relatively simple (or minimal), discrete-time model of excitation-contraction coupling.  This model explains restitution and postextrasystolic potentiation in terms of the total amount of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and a feature in which Ca2+ stored in the SR slowly becomes available for release into the sarcoplasm (see  below).\n\n2+\n2+\n\nIn their second modelling approach, J. Jeremy Rice, M. Saleet Jafri and Raimond L. Winslow develop a more detailed ventricular cell model that is able to simulate action potentials, Ca2+-handling mechanisms, and isometric force generation by the myofilaments.  This single comprehensive (or maximal) model combines two previously developed models (see  The Jafri-Rice-Winslow Ventricular Model, 1998 and  Cooperative Mechanisms in Cardiac Muscle, Rice et al., 1999).  The first ventricular cell model describes membrane currents and Ca2+-handling, and the second model of myofilaments provides the force generation of muscle contraction (see  below).  The ventricular cell model provides the Ca2+ needed to drive the myofilament contraction.  This is a feedforward pathway in which Ca2+ binds to troponin and initiates force generation by triggering myofilament contraction.  A feedback pathway also links the two models, as the affinity of troponin for Ca2+ is a function of developed force. \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nModeling short-term interval-force relations in cardiac muscle J.

This second version of the CellML model has been modified by Steve Niederer.  The CellML model was compared with Jeremy Rice's original Matlab code taken from his web page.  Changes to the CellML model include:  body temperature in the Rice Matlab code is acurate to 3sf ie body temp is 310 not 310.15.  Also in the Rice Matlab code derivative 12 the force integral is fixed to be zero.  To fix the CellML model Steve introduced: \n\n       \nSEon = 1.0;\nTo cellml model and change afterload definition to:\nif (SEon == 1)\nafterload = KSE*(SLset-Y(5));\nelse\nafterload = 0.0;\nend;\n\n \nand changed xbmodsp = 4/3 (which is the mouse specific modification for XB cycling rates)\nto xbmodsp = 1 (to represent the rat model and not the mouse)\n\n\nAnd finally Steve also reset all of the initial conditions after solving the model a coupl of times for 1000ms.\n         \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: We develop a point model of the cardiac myofilament (MF) to simulate wide variety of experimental muscle characterizations including Force-Ca relations and twitches under isometric, isosarcometric, isotonic and auxotonic conditions. Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF response. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well-suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cystolic Ca transient.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nNote that the current CellMl model describes the rat model of myofilamentcontraction. One of the goals of the published work by Rice et al. was to develop a model of the myofilaments which could be coupled to existing models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms.  Similarly, it is our intention to be able to couple the CellML model of myofilament contration with cardiac models of electrophysiology and calcium change. To achieve this we will first have to modify the rat myofilament model to convert it to a rabbit myofilament model. This can be achieved by decreasing the transition rates in the crossbridge cycle by a factor of 5 to simulate the changes in myosin isoforms (rat is predominately V1 while rabbit is V3) and species-based changes in rate.  We can then couple the model to the Chicago rabbit ventricular myocyte model by using the cytosolic Ca concentration ([Ca]c) from the Chicago model as the input to the myofilament model.  Other minor modifications are also required, as described in the paper below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\nApproximate model of cooperative activation and crossbridge cycling in cardiac muscle using ordinary differential equations, John Jeremy Rice, Fei Wang, Donald M.

        "description": "Model Structure\n\nIn cardiac muscle, steady-state force-Ca2+ (F-Ca) relations exhibit more cooperativity than that predicted by the single Ca2+ binding site on troponin.  The exact mechanisms underlying this high cooperativity are unknown.  In their 1999 paper, J. Jeremy Rice, Raimond L. Winslow and William C. Hunter present five potential models for force generation in cardiac muscle (see the figures below).  These models were constructed by assuming different subsets of three possible cooperative mechanisms: \n\n2+\n2+\n\nCooperative mechanism 1 \n is based on the theory that cross bridge formation between actin and myosin increases the affinity of troponin for Ca2+.\n2+\n\nCooperative mechanism 2 \n assumes that the binding of a cross bridge increases the rate of formation of neighbouring cross bridges and that multiple cross bridges can actin activation even in the absence of Ca2+.\n2+\n\nCooperative mechanism 2 \n simulates end-to-end interactions between adjacent troponin and tropomyosin.\n\nComparison of putative cooperative mechanisms in cardiac muscle: length dependence and dynamic responses, J. Jeremy Rice, Raimond L. Winslow and William C. Hunter, 1999, American Journal of Physiology, 276, H1734-H1754. PubMed ID: 10330260\n\n2+\n\nAll the models are similar in that they are structured around a functional unit of troponin, tropomyosin and actin.  Tropomyosin can exist in four states, two permissive or two non-permissive (referring to whether or not the actin sites are available for binding to myosin and hence cross bridge formation).  Depending on the model, one or more cross bridges exist, and these are either weakly-bound (non-force generating) or strongly bound (force generating).\n\n\nThe paper (cited below) tests the behaviours of the five models of force generation in cardiac myocytes.  The first two models provide a baseline of performance for comparison.  Models 3 to 5 are developed to incorporate more cooperative mechanisms.  From the results of these simulations, which were compared to and consistent with experimental data, it is hypothesised that multiple mechanisms of cooperativity may coexist and contribute to the responses of cardiac muscle.\n",

        "description": "Model Structure\n\nCalcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in cardiac muscle displays both gradedness and high gain.  It is graded because release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is proportional to the influx of trigger Ca2+, and high gain refers to the observation that Ca2+ release from the SR is much greater than the trigger influx.  Inherent to such high-gain systems is positive feedback, which causes an all-or-nothing response rather than graded Ca2+ release.  Such behaviour is predicted by all mathematical models in which sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx and SR Ca2+ release are directed into a single compartment, or common pool model.  \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThe previous (1998) model of cardiac calcium handling, (see Jafri-Rice-Winslow Ventricular Model, 1998) by the authors was an example of a common pool model.  While it was able to simulate frequency-dependent aspects of cardiac Ca2+ cycling and high gain, it also displayed an all-or-none rather than a graded Ca2+ release.  By contrast, their 1999 model (see the figure below) is based on functional release units (FRUs) formulated from one sarcolemmal dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), eight ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, and the volume (subspace) surrounding them.  It is assumed that a variable number of independent FRUs can be recruited to produce graded Ca2+ release.  Voltage-gated DHPR channels open adjacent RyRs via a localised increase in [Ca2+].\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nResults obtained with the stochastic model suggest that high gain and gradedness can occur by the recruitment of independent FRUs without requiring spatial [Ca2+] gradients within a functional unit, or coupling between adjacent units.\n\n2+\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling Gain and Gradedness of Ca2+ Release in the Functional Unit of the Cardiac Diadic Space John J.

It has been suggested that hearts that have been mechanically compromised by congestive heart failure display an increased prevalence of arrhythmia.  In addition, in vitro studies have shown that sudden cardiac tissue stretch can stimulate arrhythmias.  One hypothesised mechanism for the stretch sensitivity of cardiac muscle is the presence of stretch-activated channels (SACs). \n\n\nIn their 1998 study, Riemer et al. investigate the potential role of SACs in excitability and arrhythmogenesis.  To do this they added a linear, time-independent, stretch-sensitive current to the Luo-Rudy membrane model for guinea pig ventricular myocytes (see Luo-Rudy I model and Zeng et al. 1995 model for more details, and also see the figure below).  Model simulations showed that increased stretch conductance led to resting potential depolarisation, a decreased excitation threshold, altered action potential duration, and, under certain conditions, early afterdepolarisations.  From these results Riemer et al. concluded that stretch increases cellular excitability, making the heart prone to ectopic activity.  Regional effects of stretch on action potential are influenced by factors such as the SAC reversal potential, ionic conditions and baseline refractoriness throughout the heart and therefore an increased risk of arrhythmia. \n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nStretch-induced changes in arrhythmogenesis and excitability in experimentally based heart cell models, Tara L.

The material law is to calculate the stress induced in a body when a certain amount of deformation (strain) is imposed on it. The calculated stresses are used to solve a system of equations that govern the mechanics of large deformations. The example presented here is the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive material law, which defines the relationship between eight independent strain components and the stress components.\n\n \nThe Mooney-Rivlin equation was developed by Rivlin and Saunders to describe the deformation of highly elastic bodies which are incompressible (volume is conserved during deformation) and isotropic (the material has the same mechanical properties in all directions at a material point). They formulated the material law as a strain energy function in terms of the first and second principal invariants (quantitative information on the deformation) of the deformation. The formulation is called a strain energy function as the energy is conserved during deformation of these materials under constant temperature. A typical load-extension ratio curve for rubber in simple extension is shown in the figure below.\n\n\nThe model was implemented in a manner that could be used for peforming finite element model simulations on the CMISS software program developed at the Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland. Examples of how the CellML model is used can be seen here.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nLarge Elastic Deformations of Isotropic Materials VII.

The ordered progression between these phases is achieved thanks to the existence of checkpoint mechanisms based on mutual inhibition of these processes. Here we study a simple theoretical model for oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2 activity, involving mutual inhibition of the two oscillators. Each minimal oscillator is described by a three-variable cascade involving a cdk, together with the associated cyclin and cyclin-degrading enzyme. The dynamics of this skeleton model of coupled oscillators is determined as a function of the strength of their mutual inhibition. The most common mode of dynamic behavior, obtained under conditions of strong mutual inhibition, is that of alternating oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2, which correspond to the physiological situation of the ordered recurrence of the M and S phases. In addition, for weaker inhibition we obtain evidence for a variety of dynamic phenomena such as complex periodic oscillations, chaos, and the coexistence between multiple periodic or chaotic attractors. We discuss the conditions of occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior, as well as their possible physiological significance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAlternating Oscillations and Chaos in a Model of Two Coupled Biochemical Oscillators Driving Successive Phases of the Cell Cycle, Pierre-Charles Romond, Mauro Rustici, Didier Gonze, Albert GOldbeter, 1999, Annals of the New York Acedemy of Sciences, 879, 180-193.

This file is known to run in OpenCell and COR, and is set to the parameters in Table 1 and figure 3 in the paper. The model requires the use of a Normal and Uniform distribution on the variable f (causing it to occasionally spike randomly), but this feature has not been implemented in this CellML model (since we are still waiting for the publication of the 1.2 specification) and therefore we may need to return to this model later. Instead of a normal distribution, f has been manually set to spike from T_on (at day 50) to T_off only once to replicate one spike, and used to compare against the diagrams in the paper (figure 3) which it has replicated.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Although potent combination therapy is usually able to suppress plasma viral loads in HIV-1 patients to below the detection limit of conventional clinical assays, a low level of viremia frequently can be detected in plasma by more sensitive assays. Additionally, many patients experience transient episodes of viremia above the detection limit, termed viral blips, even after being on highly suppressive therapy for many years. An obstacle to viral eradication is the persistence of a latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. The mechanisms underlying low viral load persistence, slow decay of the latent reservoir, and intermittent viral blips are not fully characterized. The quantitative contributions of residual viral replication to viral and the latent reservoir persistence remain unclear. In this paper, we probe these issues by developing a mathematical model that considers latently infected cell activation in response to stochastic antigenic stimulation. We demonstrate that programmed expansion and contraction of latently infected cells upon immune activation can generate both low-level persistent viremia and intermittent viral blips. Also, a small fraction of activated T cells revert to latency, providing a potential to replenish the latent reservoir. By this means, occasional activation of latently infected cells can explain the variable decay characteristics of the latent reservoir observed in different clinical studies. Finally, we propose a phenomenological model that includes a logistic term representing homeostatic proliferation of latently infected cells. The model is simple but can robustly generate the multiphasic viral decline seen after initiation of therapy, as well as low-level persistent viremia and intermittent HIV-1 blips. Using these models, we provide a quantitative and integrated prospective into the long-term dynamics of HIV-1 and the latent reservoir in the setting of potent antiretroviral therapy.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nModeling latently infected cell activation: viral and latent reservoir persistence, and viral blips in HIV-infected patients on potent therapy, Rong L, Perelson A, 2009, PLoS Computational Biology, 5(issue 10): e1000533.

Stimulation of airway myocytes results in an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the subsequent activation of the contractile apparatus. Many contractile agonists, including acetylcholine, induce [Ca2+]i increase via Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through InsP3 receptors. Several models have been developed to explain the characteristics of InsP3-induced [Ca2+]i responses, in particular Ca2+ oscillations. The article reviews the modelling of the major structures implicated in intracellular Ca2+ handling, i.e., InsP3 receptors, SERCAs, mitochondria and Ca2+-binding cytosolic proteins. We developed theoretical models speci\ufb01cally dedicated to the airway myocyte which include the major mechanisms responsible for intracellular Ca2+ handling identi\ufb01ed in these cells. These biocomputations pointed out the importance of the relative proportion of InsP3 receptor isoforms and the respective role of the different mechanisms responsible for cytosolic Ca2+ clearance in the pattern of [Ca2+]i variations. We have developed a theoretical model of membrane conductances that predicts the variations in membrane potential and extracellular Ca2+ in\ufb02ux. Stimulation of this model by simulated increase in [Ca2+]i predicts membrane depolarisation, but not great enough to trigger a signi\ufb01cant opening of voltage-dependant Ca2+ channels. This may explain why airway contraction induced by cholinergic stimulation does not greatly depend on extracellular calcium. The development of such models of airway myocytes is important for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of airway reactivity and their possible modulation by pharmacological agents.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModelling of calcium handling in airway myocytes, Etienne Roux, Penelope J.

A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory-expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory-inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast-slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMultiple rhythmic states in a model of the respiratory central pattern generator, Rubin JE, Shevtsova NA, Ermentrout GB, Smith JC, Rybak IA, 2009, Journal of Neurophysiology, 101, 2146-1265.

Principal components of muscular tension development are the proteins actin, myosin, troponin and tropomyosin. The tension is produced by cross-bridge cycling of actin and myosin using adenosine triphosphate as energy source. The cross-bridge cycling is initiated by binding of intracellular calcium to troponin, resulting in configuration changes of tropomyosin.\n\nIn this work a hybrid model of protein interactions in cardiac tension development is derived on basis of recent measurements and descriptions on protein level. Dependencies on intracellular calcium concentration, sarcomere stretch and stretch velocity as well as cooperativity mechanisms are incorporated. The model quantifies the tension development by states associated to configurations of the involved proteins. The model enables in conjunction with electrophysiological models of cardiac myocytes the reconstruction of electro-mechanical phenomena. Numerical simulations with the hybrid model were performed, which illustrated the reconstruction of steady state and length switches experiments. The steady state experiments describe the force-cytosolic [Ca2+] relationship in intact rat cardiac trabeculae. The length switch experiments provide data on the redevelopment of force after sudden stretch in rabbit right ventricular papillary muscles. Results of the numerical simulations show quantitative agreement with experimental studies.\n\nThe hybrid model of cardiac tension development offers interfaces to further models of cardiac electro-mechanics. The hybrid model can be coupled with models of cellular electrophysiology and passive mechanics of myocardium allowing the inclusion of mechano-electrical feedback mechanisms. The hybrid model can be applied to elucidate cooperativity mechanisms, pathophysiological changes and metabolism of tension development.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling of Protein Interactions Involved in Cardiac Tension Development, F.

This particular CellML model represents the fibroblast.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nFibroblasts are the most abundant cell type present in the heart.  They are arranged in the myocardium, as a three-dimensional network, where they are responsible for the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, and also play a role in cardiac electrophysiology.  Although fibroblasts themselves are electrically in-excitable, they can contribute to the electrophysiology of neighbouring myocytes through fibroblast-myocyte coupling.  Although the electrical coupling of fibroblasts and myocytes has been demonstrated experimentally both in vivo and in vitro, the precise role of fibroblasts as electrical bridges between myocytes still remains to be defined.   \n\n\nIn the paper described here, Frank Sachse, Alonso Moreno and J. A. Abildskov address this issue by presenting mathematical models of cellular and multi-cellular electrophysiology.  A novel mathematical model of cardiac fibroblasts was developed on the basis of experimental data from whole cell patch clamp and polymerase chain reaction studies.  This model was then applied, together with models of ventricular myocytes (which were based on the Pandit et al. 2001 model of the rat left ventricular myocyte), to determine the electrophysiological effects of heterogeneous electrical coupling of cells.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nElectrophysiological Modeling of Fibroblasts and Their Interaction with Myocytes, F.B.

Unfortunately, there are no comparable figures in the published paper for a curation check of the CellML model results. \n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The modal gating behavior of single sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release/ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels was assessed. We find that the gating of RyR channels spontaneously shifts between high (H) and low (L) levels of activity and inactive periods where no channel openings are detected (I). Moreover, we find that there is evidence for multiple gating modes within H activity, which we term H1 and H2 mode. Our results demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms regulating gating are similar in native and purified channels. Dwell-time distributions of L activity were best fitted by three open and five closed significant exponential components whereas dwell-time distributions of H1 activity were best fitted by two to three open and four closed significant exponential components. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] cause an increase in open probability (Po) within L activity and an increase in the probability of occurrence of H activity. Open lifetime distributions within L activity were Ca2+ independent whereas open lifetime distributions within H activity were Ca2+ dependent. This study is the first attempt to estimate RyR single-channel kinetic parameters from sequences of idealized dwell-times and to develop kinetic models of RyR gating using the criterion of maximum likelihood. We propose distinct kinetic schemes for L, H1, and H2 activity that describe the major features of sheep cardiac RyR channel gating at these levels of activity.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMarkovian Models Of Low And High Activity Levels Of Cardiac Ryanodine Receptors, Elena Saftenku, Alan J.

To quantitatively understand cardiac metabolism during ischemia, we have developed a mechanistic, mathematical model based on biochemical mass balances and reaction kinetics in cardiac cells. By numerical solution of model equations, computer simulations showed the dynamic responses in glucose, fatty acid, glucose-6-phosphate, glycogen, triglyceride, pyruvate, lactate, acetyl-CoA, and free-CoA as well as CO2, O2, phosphocreatine/creatine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NADH/NAD+), and adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP). When myocardial ischemia was simulated by a 60% reduction in coronary blood flow, the model generated myocardial concentrations, uptakes, and fluxes that were consistent with experimental data from in vivo pig studies. After 60 min of ischemia the concentrations of glycogen, phosphocreatine, and ATP were decreased by 60%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. With the onset of ischemia, myocardial lactate concentration increased and the myocardium switched from net consumer to net producer of lactate. Our model predicted a rapid 13-fold increase in NADH/NAD+, but only a twofold increase in the ratio of acetyl-CoA to free-CoA. These findings are consistent with the concept that pyruvate oxidation is inhibited during ischemia partially by the rise in NADH/NAD+.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMechanistic model of myocardial energy metabolism under normal and ischemic conditions, Jennifer E.

The model successfully reconstructs the experimental action potentials at various concentrations of external Ca2+ and K+. Increasing the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ current (I(CaL)) prolongs the duration of the action potential and thereby slightly decreases the spontaneous rate. On the other hand, a negative voltage shift of I(CaL) gating by a few mV markedly increases the spontaneous rate. When the amplitude of sustained inward current (I(st)) is increased, the spontaneous rate is increased irrespective of the I(CaL) amplitude. Increasing [Ca2+](o) shortens the action potential and increases the spontaneous rate. When the spontaneous activity is stopped by decreasing I(CaL) amplitude, the resting potential is nearly constant (-35 mV) over 1-15 mM [K+](o) as observed in the experiment. This is because the conductance of the inward background non-selective cation current balances with the outward [K+](o)-dependent K+ conductance. The unique role of individual voltage- and time-dependent ion channels is clearly demonstrated and distinguished from that of the background current by calculating an instantaneous zero current potential (\"lead potential\") during the course of the spontaneous activity.  \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRole of Individual Ionic Current Systems in the SA Node Hypothesized by a Model Study, Sarai N, Matsuoka S, Kuratomi S, Ono K, and Noma A, 2003, The Japanese Journal of Physiology, 53, 125-134.

Version 03 was created from Version 02 by James Lawson on 01/05/07 and now includes the pharmacological simulations described in the paper. This file is known to read in PCEnv.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nCurrently, drug design and development takes, on average, 12 years and costs more than 800 million US dollars.  Much of this time and money is spent on experiments and drugs that fail.  There is very little mechanistic understanding as to how the various levels of biological complexity - from molecular interactions, to cellular function, to tissue organisation, to whole organs and beyond - are integrated.  Hierarchical mathematical models provide a method for integrating this data.  Specifically, in the model described here, Sarkar and Lauffenburger focus on the case of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF).\n\n\nGCSF is of great clinical importance, especially for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  The drug is injected into the blood stream where it then diffuses to the bone marrow and binds to its receptor GCSFR on precursor cells, inducing them to replicate and differentiate into mature neutrophils.  In this way, the neutrophil count of immunocompromised patients is significantly increased.  However, the bone marrow precursor cells engulf and degrade the GCSF, a negative feedback mechanism that reduces its potency.  In addition, mature bone cells express the receptor GCSFR, and they bind, engulf and degrade the drug from the bloodstream.  Thus, there is a significant negative feedback loop that reduces the lifetime of the drug.\n\n\nThe mathematical model developed by Sarkar and Lauffenburger relates extracellular GCSF depletion to the molecular properties of the ligand and the cells expressing the GCSF receptor (see the figure below).  The authors then further integrated this cell-level model into a physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCell-Level Pharmacokinetic Model of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor: Implications for Ligand Lifetime and Potency in Vivo, Casim A.

Where possible unit checking was carried out and to our knowledge they are consistent. \n          \n\n          It should be noted that the paper does not provide values for [K], [Mg], and [Ca]. Correspondence with the author of the publication has provided values for these variables, namely; 135mM, 1mM and a value for Ca which is predicted dynamically from the Shannon et al. model (also in the CellML Model Respository). Unfortunately, the Ca concentration was calculated using a procedural command in the original Matlab code.  We are currently working on a solution to this in the CellML model.  \n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Calmodulin (CaM) mediates Ca-dependent regulation of numerous pathways in the heart including calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN), yet the local Ca(2+) signals responsible for their selective activation are unclear. To assess when and where CaM, CaMKII and CaN may be activated in the cardiac myocyte, we integrated new mechanistic computational models of CaM, CaMKII and CaN with the Shannon-Bers model of excitation-contraction coupling in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. These models are validated with independent in vitro data. In the intact myocyte, model simulations predict that CaM is highly activated in the dyadic cleft during each beat, but not appreciably in the cytosol. CaMKII-deltaC was almost insensitive to cytosolic Ca due to relatively low CaM affinity. Dyadic cleft CaMKII exhibits dynamic frequency-dependent responses to Ca yet autophosphorylates only when local phosphatases are suppressed. In contrast, dyadic cleft CaN in beating myocytes is predicted to be constitutively active, while the extremely high CaN affinity for CaM allows gradual integration of small cytosolic CaM signals. Reversing CaM affinities for CaMKII and CaN also reverses their characteristic local responses. Deactivation of both CaMKII and CaN seems dominated by Ca dissociation from the complex (vs. Ca-CaM dissociation from the target). In summary, the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII and CaN determine their sensitivity to local Ca signals in cardiac myocytes.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCalmodulin mediates differential sensitivity of CaMKII and calcineurin to local Ca2+ in cardiac myocytes, Saucerman JJ, Bers DM, 2009, Biophysical Journal, 95, 4597-4612.

We used systems analysis to investigate how the components and topology of this signaling network permit neurohormonal control of excitation-contraction coupling in the rat ventricular myocyte. A kinetic model integrating beta-adrenergic signaling with excitation-contraction coupling was formulated, and each subsystem was validated with independent biochemical and physiological measurements. Model analysis was used to investigate quantitatively the effects of specific molecular perturbations. 3-Fold overexpression of adenylyl cyclase in the model allowed an 85% higher rate of cyclic AMP synthesis than an equivalent overexpression of beta 1-adrenergic receptor, and manipulating the affinity of Gs alpha for adenylyl cyclase was a more potent regulator of cyclic AMP production. The model predicted that less than 40% of adenylyl cyclase molecules may be stimulated under maximal receptor activation, and an experimental protocol is suggested for validating this prediction. The model also predicted that the endogenous heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor may enhance basal cyclic AMP buffering by 68% and increasing the apparent Hill coefficient of protein kinase A activation from 1.0 to 2.0. Finally, phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban were found sufficient to predict the dominant changes in myocyte contractility, including a 2.6x increase in systolic calcium (inotropy) and a 28% decrease in calcium half-relaxation time (lusitropy). By performing systems analysis, the consequences of molecular perturbations in the beta-adrenergic signaling network may be understood within the context of integrative cellular physiology.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nModeling beta-adrenergic control of cardiac myocyte contractility in silico\n                                       , Jeffrey J.

By transducing a range of environmental cues such as hormones and neurotransmitters, they coordinate many of the physiologicval reposnses to changes in the cell environment.  In comparision with metabolism, signalling networks are poorly characterised.  They account for a large portion of biological complexity, and understanding the function of these complex signalling networks presents a challenge to modern biology, requiring a combined approach of experimental analysis and modelling.  \n\n\nSystems models of cell signalling can be considered at two levels of detail: abstract top-down models and mechansistic systems analyses.  Top-down modelling, often based on protein interaction data, is useful for elucidating qualitative, topological features of signalling networks.  Mechanistic systems models usually describe the biochemical reactions with kinetic rate laws and differential equations.  There are several different approaches for devloping mechanistic systems models of signal transduction.  These different methods are reviewed by Saucerman and McCulloch in the 2004 publication described here.  As a case study of model devlopment and analysis, they examine the funcyional roles of phospholamban, the L-type calcium channel, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin I phosphorylation upon beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat ventricular myocyte (see the figure below). \n\n\nModel analysis revealed that although protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor greatly increases its calcium sensitivity, calcium autoregulation may adapt quickly be negating potential increases in contractility.  The authors concluded that phospholamban phosphorylation is the main mechanism for increased sarcoplasmic reticulum load and calcium relaxation rate during beta-adrenergic stimulation, whereas both phospholamban and the L-type calcium channle contribute to increased systolic calcium.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMechanistic systems models of cell signalling networks: a case study of nyocyte adrenergic regulation, Jeffrey J.

A mathematical model predicts initial viremia and CD4+ cell drop after HIV infection and thereafter a slow progressive decline in the number of CD4+ cells, although for an extended period HIV is kept at a relatively low level by an active immune response. The time span T until the number of CD4+ cells falls below 20 per cent of its normal value depends on several model parameters. Assuming Gaussian distributions for these parameters, the model predicts a distribution function for T which resembles the observed distribution function for the incubation period to AIDS.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model for AIDS pathogenesis, Schenzle D, 1994,\n            Statistics in Medicine, 13, (19-20), 2067-2079.

The model also runs in COR but due to the time unit being days the model is not ideal for simulation in COR (where the default unit of time is ms).  The units have been checked and they are consistent. The LH system (eq 1a-1e) and the FSH system (eq 2a-2e) are both described in this CellML model. Parameter values have been taken from tables 1 and 2 in the original published paper.

The endocrine system is largely self-regulating, compensating for moderate changes in dietary phytoestrogens (e.g., in soy products) and normal variations in physiology. However, severe changes in dietary or oral exposures or in health status (e.g., anorexia) , can completely disrupt the menstrual cycle in women. Thus, risk assessment tools should account for normal regulation and its limits. We present a mathematical model for the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women as a function of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin blood levels. The model reproduces the time courses of LH and FSH during the menstrual cycle and correctly predicts observed effects of administered estrogen and progesterone on LH and FSH during clinical studies. The model should be useful for predicting effects of hormonally active substances, both in the pharmaceutical sciences and in toxicology and risk assessment.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of gonadotropin regulation during the menstrual cycle in women: qualitative features Paul M.

The current model is based on the M1 model from the paper, but other variants are possible via simple modifications. In particular, to recreate the published results found in most of the paper, Ca(2+) concentration was modeled as an explicit function of time, and graphed on a log scale.  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: A stretch-induced increase of active tension is one of the most important properties of the heart, known as the Frank-Starling law. Although a variation of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity with sarcomere length (SL) change was found to be involved, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully clarified. Some recent experimental studies indicate that a reduction of the lattice spacing between thin and thick filaments, through the increase of passive tension caused by the sarcomeric protein titin with an increase in SL within the physiological range, promotes formation of force-generating crossbridges (Xbs). However, the mechanism by which the Xb concentration determines the degree of cooperativity for a given SL has so far evaded experimental elucidation. In this simulation study, a novel, rather simple molecular-based cardiac contraction model, appropriate for integration into a ventricular cell model, was designed, being the first model to introduce experimental data on titin-based radial tension to account for the SL-dependent modulation of the interfilament lattice spacing and to include a conformational change of troponin I (TnI). Simulation results for the isometric twitch contraction time course, the length-tension and the force-[Ca(2+)] relationships are comparable to experimental data. A complete potential Frank-Starling mechanism was analyzed by this simulation study. The SL-dependent modulation of the myosin binding rate through titin's passive tension determines the Xb concentration which then alters the degree of positive cooperativity affecting the rate of the TnI conformation change and causing the Hill coefficient to be SL-dependent.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMechanism of the Frank-Starling law-- A simulation study with a novel cardiac muscle contraction model that includes titin and tropomyosin, Natalie S.

It shows that EGF-induced responses are remarkably stable over a 100-fold range of ligand concentration and that the critical parameter in determining signal efficacy is the initial velocity of receptor activation.

This model takes into account intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, membrane potential, a non-selective cation channel, and two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, as well as intra- and extracellular Ca2+ sources. The model reproduces the experimental data available, and predicts certain quantities which would be hard to obtain experimentally, like the individual K+ channel currents when the membrane potential is allowed to freely evolve, the implication of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and the total K+ released during stimulation. The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order. This concentration change is compatible with the hypothesis that K+ contributes to the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor phenomenon.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModelling the electrophysiological endothelial cell response to bradykinin, Alexander Schuster, Jean-Louis Beny, and Jean-Jacques Meister, 2003, European Biophysics Journal, 32, 370-380.

A novel mechanistic model of postreceptor events including phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequent activation of downstream kinases Akt and protein kinase C-zeta is coupled with previously validated subsystem models of insulin receptor binding, receptor recycling, and GLUT4 translocation. A system of differential equations is defined by the structure of the model. Rate constants and model parameters are constrained by published experimental data. Model simulations of insulin dose-response experiments agree with published experimental data and also generate expected qualitative behaviors such as sequential signal amplification and increased sensitivity of downstream components. We examined the consequences of incorporating feedback pathways as well as representing pathological conditions, such as increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to illustrate the utility of our model for exploring molecular mechanisms. We conclude that mathematical modeling of signal transduction pathways is a useful approach for gaining insight into the complexities of metabolic insulin signaling.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of metabolic insulin signaling pathways, Ahmad R.

This electromechanical coupling is controlled by free cytosolic calcium.  Regional heterogeneity of the electrophysiological properties within the human ventricles is based on changes in ion channel kinetics and density withinh the myocytes of the heart walls.  This heterogeneity not only influences the electrophysiological properties of the heart, but also cellular force devlopment.   \n\n\nIn the Seemann et al. 2003 publication described here, the authors aim to fit new parameters based on experimental data to an existing mathematical model of a human myocyte, and to investigate the effects of these new values on electrophysiology and force development in a computer model.  The cellular model consists of two submodels.  One model is needed to describe the electrophysiology of the cell (see the first figure below).

The model equations and output were checked using the original matlab code, and it currently recreates the Pace1 Stimulus protocol described. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We have developed a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ handling and ionic currents in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. The objective was to develop a model that: 1), accurately reflects Ca-dependent Ca release; 2), uses realistic parameters, particularly those that concern Ca transport from the cytosol; 3), comes to steady state; 4), simulates basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; and 5), runs on a normal desktop computer. The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na]i dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca]i; and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy. A particular emphasis is placed upon reproducing the nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca release upon SR Ca load. We conclude that this model is more robust than many previously existing models and reproduces many experimental results using parameters based largely on experimental measurements in myocytes.   \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical treatment of integrated Ca dynamics within the ventricular myocyte, Thomas R.

Pinpointing cardiovascular system dysfunction is often difficult because the clinical signs, or the availability and interpretation of physiological measurements, are unreliable. Often patient-specific information is incomplete or confusing, as it comes from a diverse range of sources, such as invasive and non-invasive pressure measurements, flow rates and electrocardiogram signals. Health professionals therefore rely on intuition and experience to make a \"clinical\" diagnosis and decide treatment. Sometimes this approach results in multiple therapies being applied until a suitable treatment is found. Poor outcomes result from failure to quickly and correctly diagnose and treat the underlying condition. We introduce the concept of using full circulatory and cardiovascular models to aggregate the large number of diverse signals facing clinicians into a clear physiological picture of haemodynamic status. We briefly review the field, still in its infancy, of such models, focusing primarily on the basic approaches taken in the literature. Finally, we present one of the more advanced and best validated models, including initial results of animal validation studies. The overall approach is shown to have significant potential to provide clear, measured insight to replace often misled intuition in the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of circulatory dysfunction in critical care. In the future, models and modern sensors will increasingly \"invade\" the critical care environment, and will provide the opportunity for better, more consistent care at the bedside in real time.   \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the Cardiovascular System, Geoffrey M Shaw, J Geoffrey Chase, Christina Starfinger, Bram W Smith, Christopher E Hann, Thomas Desaive, Alexandre Ghuysen, 2007, Critical Care and Resuscitation, 9, 264-269.

METHODS: Using an ionic-based theoretical model of the cardiac ventricular cell, the dynamic LRd model, we have simulated the three major component conditions of acute ischemia (elevated [K]o, acidosis and anoxia) at the level of individual ionic currents and ionic concentrations. The conditions were applied individually and in combination to identify ionic mechanisms responsible for reduced excitability at rest potentials, delayed recovery of excitability, and shortened action potential duration. RESULTS: Increased extracellular potassium ([K]o) had the major effect on cell excitability by depolarizing resting membrane potential (Vrest), causing reduction in sodium channel availability. Acidosis caused a [K]o-independent reduction in maximum upstroke velocity, (dVm/dt)max. A transition from sodium-current dominated to calcium-current dominated upstroke occurred, and calcium current alone was able to sustain the upstroke, but only after sodium channels were almost completely (97%) inactivated. Acidic conditions prevented the transition to calcium dominated upstroke by acidic reduction of both sodium and calcium currents. Anoxia, simulated by lowering [ATP]i and activating the APT-dependent potassium current, IK(ATP), was the only process that could decrease action potential duration by more than 50% and reproduce AP shape changes that are observed experimentally. Acidic or anoxic depression of the L-type calcium current could not reproduce the observed action potential shape changes and APD shortening. Delayed recovery of excitability, known as 'post-repolarization refractoriness', was determined by the voltage-dependent kinetics of sodium channel recovery; Vrest depolarization caused by elevated [K]o increased the time constant of (dVm/dt)max recovery from tau = 10.3 ms at [K]o = 4.5 mM to tau = 81.4 ms at [K]o = 12 mM, reflecting major slowing of sodium-channel recovery. Anoxia and acidosis had little affect on tau. CONCLUSIONS: The major conditions of acute ischemia, namely elevated [K]o, acidosis and anoxia, applied at the ionic channel level are sufficient to simulate the major electrical changes associated with ischemia. Depression of membrane excitability and delayed recovery of excitability in the single, unloaded cell are caused by elevated [K]o with additional excitability depression by acidosis. Major changes in action potential duration and shape can only be accounted for by anoxia-dependent opening of IK(ATP).\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nElectrophysiological effects of acute myocardial ischemia: a theoretical study of altered cell excitability and action potential duration, Robin M.

These receptors are close to the L-type calcium channels in the cell surface membrane, and when the cell is depolarised, the calcium that enters the cell through the L-type channels is confined within a microdomain (the dyadic junction).  The RyR then sense this increase in [Ca2+]i and respond by opening and releasing more calcium from the SR in a process known as calcium-induced calcium releases (CICR).  The cell's contractile elements are activated by this increase in [Ca2+]i and the cell contracts.  A calcium-activated uptake pump then pumps calcium back into the SR.  This interaction between membrane potential and intracellular calcium cycling forms the basis of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling.  The calcium system is driven by an action potential waveform that is itself dependent on the dynamics of the calcium system.\n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nThere have been several efforts to mathematically model intracellular calcium dynamics, such as:\n\n\nModelling the Functional Ca2+ Release Unit, 1999, Rice et al., 1999\n\n2+\n\nModel of Ryanodine Receptor Gating in Cardiac Muscle, 1999, Stern et al.\n\n\n\nSobie et al. Mechanism of Cardiac Ca2+ Spark Termination, 2002\n\n2+\n\nwhich focus on the detailed calcium dynamics within the dyadic junction.  Several authors have developed models of calcium cycling at the whole cell level, including:\n\n\nLuo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994\n\n\nJafri-Rice-Winslow Ventricular Model, 1998\n\n\nSnyder et al., Cardiocyte Ca2+ Dynamics, 2000\n\n2+\nHowever, some of these models are lacking in physiological detail; for example, some ignore intracellular calcium compartmentation, or they overlook the fact that calcium release from the SR is in fact the summation of several discrete events.\n\n\nIn the publication described here, Shiferaw et al. present a new model of EC coupling in ventricular myocytes (see \n    the figure\n   below).  In contrast to the previously published models this one represents calcium release from the SR as a summation of elementary release events that correspond to calcium sparks.  In addition, the model includes features that are absent in the earlier models, such as:\n\na description of intracellular sodium accumulation;\ncompartmentation of myoplasm into a submembrane space near the sarcolemma, and the rest of the myoplasm; and\na calcium diffusional delay between the network SR (NSR) and the junctional SR (JSR)\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModel of Intracellular Calcium Cycling in Ventricular Myocytes, Y.

Pituitary corticotroph cells generate repetitive action potentials and associated Ca2+ transients in response to the agonist CRH.  The mechanisms underlying this process are complex.  CRH is known to activate the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.  PKA phosphorylates L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, activating them and contributing to the generation of an action potential and Ca2+ transients.     \n\n2+\n2+\n2+\n\nIn an earlier Hodgkin-Huxley type mathematical model of this process, LeBeau et al. showed than an increase in the L-type current was sufficient to generate repetitive action potentials from a resting state in the model (LeBeau et al., 1997).  However, they found that the action potential frequency of the model was much higher than the observed experimental action potential frequency.  This problem was addressed in the current model described here (the complete original paper reference is cited below).    \n\n\nIn addition to the activation of the L-type current, CRH also inhibits an inwardly rectifying K+ current.  This current helps to maintain a negative membrane resting potential.  Inhibition of this inward rectifying K+ current enhances membrane depolarisation and increases membrane excitability.  By adding a component that represents the inward rectifying K+ current to the original model, the new model simulates the dual modulatory action of CRH on inward rectifier and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels better describes the experimentally observed CHR-induced effects (see the figure below).  \n\n+\n+\n+\n2+\n\nCRH-induced Electrical Activity and Calcium Signalling in Pituitary Corticotrophs, Paul R.

Taking a step towards creating a complete mathematical model of calcium homeostasis, we focus on the short-term dynamics of calcium homeostasis and consider the response of the parathyroid glands to acute changes in plasma Ca(2+) concentration. We review available models, discuss their limitations, then present a two-pool, linear, time-varying model to describe the dynamics of this calcium homeostasis subsystem, the Ca-PTH axis. We propose that plasma PTH concentration and plasma Ca(2+) concentration bear an asymmetric reverse sigmoid relation. The parameters of our model are successfully estimated based on clinical data corresponding to three healthy subjects that have undergone induced hypocalcemic clamp tests. In the first validation of this kind, with parameters estimated separately for each subject we test the model's ability to predict the same subject's induced hypercalcemic clamp test responses. Our results demonstrate that a two-pool, linear, time-varying model with an asymmetric reverse sigmoid relation characterizes the short-term dynamics of the Ca-PTH axis.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of parathyroid hormone response to acute changes in plasma ionized calcium concentration in humans, Shrestha RP, Hollot CV, Chipkin SR, Schmitt CP, and Chait Y, 2010, Mathematical Biosciences, 226, 46-57.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n          This CellML model represents the [CC] model from the original published paper. Parameter values have been taken from table 2, SOL1 for the [CC] model. The CellML model runs in OpenCell to recreate the published results. The units have been checked and are consistent. The model will not run in COR due to the presence of differential algebraic equations - or \"circular arguments\".  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables. The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling. \n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\nNonlinearities make a difference: comparison of two common Hill-type models with real muscle, Tobias Siebert, Christian Rode, Walter Herzog, Olaf Till and Reinhard Blickhan, 2008, Biological Cybernetics, 98, 133-143.

        "description": "Model Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The goal of this simulation study is to examine, in a sheet of myocardium, the contribution of anode and cathode break phenomena in terminating a spiral wave reentry by the defibrillation shock. The tissue is represented as a homogeneous bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratios. Two case studies are presented in this article: tissue that can electroporate at high levels of transmembrane potential, and model tissue that does not support electroporation. In both cases, the spiral wave is initiated via cross-field stimulation of the bidomain sheet. The extracellular defibrillation shock is delivered via two small electrodes located at opposite tissue boundaries. Modifications in the active membrane kinetics enable the delivery of high-strength defibrillation shocks. Numerical solutions are obtained using an efficient semi-implicit predictor-corrector scheme that allows one to execute the simulations within reasonable time. The simulation results demonstrate that anode and/or cathode break excitations contribute significantly to the activity during and after the shock. For a successful defibrillation shock, the virtual electrodes and the break excitations restrict the spiral wave and render the tissue refractory so it cannot further maintain the reentry. The results also indicate that electroporation alters the anode/cathode break phenomena, the major impact being on the timing of the cathode-break excitations. Thus, electroporation results in different patterns of transmembrane potential distribution after the shock. This difference in patterns may or may not result in change of the outcome of the shock.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nAnode/cathode make and break phenomena during defibrillation: Does electroporation make a difference?, Skouibine, K., Trayanova, N., Moore, P. 1999, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 46, 769-777.

It forms part of the brain stem respiratory network computational model described by Smith et al. 2007, and modified by Dr Carlo Laing.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: Mammalian central pattern generators (CPGs) producing rhythmic movements exhibit extremely robust and flexible behavior. Network architectures that enable these features are not well understood. Here we studied organization of the brain stem respiratory CPG. By sequential rostral to caudal transections through the pontine-medullary respiratory network within an in situ perfused rat brain stem-spinal cord preparation, we showed that network dynamics reorganized and new rhythmogenic mechanisms emerged. The normal three-phase respiratory rhythm transformed to a two-phase and then to a one-phase rhythm as the network was reduced. Expression of the three-phase rhythm required the presence of the pons, generation of the two-phase rhythm depended on the integrity of Botzinger and pre-Botzinger complexes and interactions between them, and the one-phase rhythm was generated within the pre-Botzinger complex. Transformation from the three-phase to a two-phase pattern also occurred in intact preparations when chloride-mediated synaptic inhibition was reduced. In contrast to the three-phase and two-phase rhythms, the one-phase rhythm was abolished by blockade of persistent sodium current (I(NaP)). A model of the respiratory network was developed to reproduce and explain these observations. The model incorporated interacting populations of respiratory neurons within spatially organized brain stem compartments. Our simulations reproduced the respiratory patterns recorded from intact and sequentially reduced preparations. Our results suggest that the three-phase and two-phase rhythms involve inhibitory network interactions, whereas the one-phase rhythm depends on I(NaP). We conclude that the respiratory network has rhythmogenic capabilities at multiple levels of network organization, allowing expression of motor patterns specific for various physiological and pathophysiological respiratory behaviors.\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSpatial and functional architecture of the mammalian brain stem respiratory network: a hierarchy of three oscillatory mechanisms, Smith JC, Abdala AP, Koizumi H, Rybak IA, Paton JF, 2007, Journal of Neurophysiology, 98, 3370-3387.

        "description": "Model Status\n This CellML model will run in PCEnv and OpenCell to recreate the published results. Note that the model will not run in COR because it contains differential algebraic equations (DAEs).  The CellML transaltion of the model is based on the original Matlab code obtained from the model authors. However, the CellML model will only simulate 14 heart beats, because if statements (piecewise equations) were used instead of a remainder operator to cycle the heart beat, but this number of beats can be increased if desired.               \nModel Structure\nAbstract: Characterising circulatory dysfunction and choosing a suitable treatment is often difficult and time consuming, and can result in a deterioration in patient condition, or unsuitable therapy choices. A stable minimal model of the human cardiovascular system (CVS) is developed with the ultimate specific aim of assisting medical staff for rapid, on site modelling to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Models found in the literature simulate specific areas of the CVS with limited direct usefulness to medical staff. Others model the full CVS as a closed loop system, but they were found to be very complex, difficult to solve, or unstable. This paper develops a model that uses a minimal number of governing equations with the primary goal of accurately capturing trends in the CVS dynamics in a simple, easily solved, robust model. The model is shown to have long term stability and consistency with non-specific initial conditions as a result. An \"open on pressure close on flow\" valve law is created to capture the effects of inertia and the resulting dynamics of blood flow through the cardiac valves. An accurate, stable solution is performed using a method that varies the number of states in the model depending on the specific phase of the cardiac cycle, better matching the real physiological conditions. Examples of results include a 9% drop in cardiac output when increasing the thoracic pressure from -4 to 0 mmHg, and an increase in blood pressure from 120/80 to 165/130 mmHg when the systemic resistance is doubled. These results show that the model adequately provides appropriate magnitudes and trends that are in agreement with existing data for a variety of physiologically verified test cases simulating human CVS function.   \nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\nMinimal haemodynamic system model including ventricular interaction and valve dynamics, Bram W Smith, J Geoffrey Chase, Roger I Nokes, Geoffrey M Shaw, Graeme Wake, 2004, Medical Engineering and Physics, 26, 131-139.

A lumping scheme is presented which exploits the differences in timescales associated with fast and slow transitions between model states, while maintaining the thermodynamic properties of the model. The goal of this approach is to contribute to modelling of the effects of disturbances to metabolism, associated with ischaemic heart disease, on cardiac cell function. The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Lauger and Apell, Eur. Biophys. J. 13 (1986) 309, for which the principles of free energy transduction are used to link the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis (deltaGATP) to the transition rates between states of the model. An iterative minimisation algorithm is implemented to determine the transition rate parameters based on the model fit to experimental data. Finally, the relationship between deltaGATP and pump cycling direction is investigated and compared with recent experimental findings.\n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDevelopment of models of active ion transport for whole-cell modelling: cardiac sodium-potassium pump as a case study, N.

However, many models of this receptor do not agree with recent experimental data on the dynamic responses of the receptor. We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca(2+) binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca(2+) decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca(2+)-induced receptor activation increases with Ca(2+) and is faster than Ca(2+)-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca(2+) even when IP(3) is bound. Our results emphasize that measurement of steady-state properties alone is insufficient to characterize the functional properties of the receptor.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA dynamic model of the type-2 inositol triphosphate receptor, James Sneyd and Jean-Francois Dufour, 2002, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 99, 2398-2403.

Note that the published paper alone does not contain the full set of equations required to describe the complete model. As stated in the paper, certain equtions were taken from a previously published model (Sneyd and Dufour, 2002, also available as a CellML model). Where initial conditions were not defined in the paper, arbitary values were used to complete the CellML model description (for c, ce, R, O, I_1, I_2, S and A). The CellML model output looks reasonable, with Calcium oscillations generated, however it is likely the output does not perfectly match the published model description. There are no published figures of changing calcium concentration agaisnt time so we cannot confirm the accuracy of the CellML model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: It is known that Ca(2+) influx plays an important role in the modulation of inositol trisphosphate-generated Ca(2+) oscillations, but controversy over the mechanisms underlying these effects exists. In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca(2+) entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca(2+) entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca(2+) entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca(2+) in the cell (the Ca(2+) load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca(2+) load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca(2+) influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca(2+) load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca(2+).       \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nControl of calcium oscillations by membrane fluxes, J.

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater.

It does not at present replicate the published results, most likely because there are a number of gating or switching processes described in the paper that were unable to be replicated precisely.  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Cardiac contraction and relaxation dynamics result from a set of simultaneously interacting Ca(2+) regulatory mechanisms. In this study, cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics were modeled using a set of six differential equations that were based on theories, equations, and parameters described in previous studies. Among the unique features of the model was the inclusion of bidirectional modulatory interplay between the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) release channel (SRRC) and calsequestrin (CSQ) in the SR lumen, where CSQ acted as a dynamic rather than simple Ca(2+) buffer, and acted as a Ca(2+) sensor in the SR lumen as well. The inclusion of this control mechanism was central in overcoming a number of assumptions that would otherwise have to be made about SRRC kinetics, SR Ca(2+) release rates, and SR Ca(2+) release termination when the SR lumen is assumed to act as a simple, buffered Ca(2+) sink. The model was sufficient to reproduce a graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) response, CICR with high gain, and a system with reasonable stability. As constructed, the model successfully replicated the results of several previously published experiments that dealt with the Ca(2+) dependence of the SRRC (, J. Gen. Physiol. 85:247-289), the refractoriness of the SRRC (, Am. J. Physiol. 270:C148-C159), the SR Ca(2+) load dependence of SR Ca(2+) release (, Am. J. Physiol. 268:C1313-C1329;, J. Biol.

Physiol. 111:491-504), the effect of Ca(2+) trigger duration on SR Ca(2+) release (, Am. J. Physiol. 258:C944-C954), the apparent relationship that exists between sarcoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticular calcium concentrations (, Biophys. J. 73:1524-1531), and a variety of contraction frequency-dependent alterations in sarcoplasmic [Ca(2+)] dynamics that are normally observed in the laboratory, including rest potentiation, a negative frequency-[Ca(2+)] relationship, and extrasystolic potentiation. Furthermore, under the condition of a simulated Ca(2+) overload, an alternans-like state was produced. In summary, the current model of cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics provides an integrated theoretical framework of fundamental cellular Ca(2+) regulatory processes that is sufficient to predict a broad array of observable experimental outcomes.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Model of Cardiocyte Ca2+ Dynamics with a Novel Representation of Sarcoplasmic Reticular Ca2+ Control, Steven M.

It contains the sum MathML element, which is not supported by PCEnv, OpenCell or COR, rendering further curation useless. Inspection of the model suggests that there are significant errors beyond the presence of the sum operator that would render it unsuitable for description in CellML. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: A Ca(2+) spark arises when a cluster of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) channels (ryanodine receptors or RyRs) opens to release calcium in a locally regenerative manner. Normally triggered by Ca(2+) influx across the sarcolemmal or transverse tubule membrane neighboring the cluster, the Ca(2+) spark has been shown to be the elementary Ca(2+) signaling event of excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle. However, the question of how the Ca(2+) spark terminates remains a central, unresolved issue. Here we present a new model, \"sticky cluster,\" of SR Ca(2+) release that simulates Ca(2+) spark behavior and enables robust Ca(2+) spark termination. Two newly documented features of RyR behavior have been incorporated in this otherwise simple model: \"coupled gating\" and an opening rate that depends on SR lumenal [Ca(2+)]. Using a Monte Carlo method, local Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from clusters containing between 10 and 100 RyRs is modeled. After release is triggered, Ca(2+) flux from RyRs diffuses into the cytosol and binds to intracellular buffers and the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3 to produce the model Ca(2+) spark. Ca(2+) sparks generated by the sticky cluster model resemble those observed experimentally, and Ca(2+) spark duration and amplitude are largely insensitive to the number of RyRs in a cluster. As expected from heart cell investigation, the spontaneous Ca(2+) spark rate in the model increases with elevated cytosolic or SR lumenal [Ca(2+)]. Furthermore, reduction of RyR coupling leads to prolonged model Ca(2+) sparks just as treatment with FK506 lengthens Ca(2+) sparks in heart cells. This new model of Ca(2+) spark behavior provides a \"proof of principle\" test of a new hypothesis for Ca(2+) spark termination and reproduces critical features of Ca(2+) sparks observed experimentally.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nTermination of Cardiac Ca2+ Sparks: An Investigative Mathematical Model of Calcium-Induced Calcium Release, Eric A.

The units have been checked and are consistent.  This particular variant of the model simulates a continuous infusion of prolactin over a nine day period.  \n          \nModel Structure\n\nWhen prolactin was first discovered it was identified exclusively as being a lactogenic hormone.  However, since its initial discovery a wide range of biological functions have been assigned to prolactin, including water and electrolyte regulation, growth and development, metamorphosis, cell proliferation and differentiation, behaviour and immunoregulation.  While the principal site of prolactin synthesis and secretion is the anterior pituitary gland, it is also produced locally by other tissues, including the skin.\n\n\nProlactin binds to a transmembrane cell surface receptor which exists as multiple isoforms, generated from a single gene by alternative splicing.  These receptors are expressed throughout the body in many different tissues, consistent with prolactin's diverse range of physiological roles.  Prolactin binds sequentially two two receptors, via two binding sites of differing affinities, to produce a dimer complex.  This then initiates an intracellular signal transduction pathway, usually via a kinase cascade.  While ligand-mediated receptor down-regulation has been observed (negative feedback), in certain tissues prolactin is also able to up-regulate expression of its own receptor (positive feedback).  Signalling mechanisms within the cell can regulate receptor expression at the transcriptional level, and feedback can also occur on a larger spatial scale via different endocrine mechanisms.  In combination, these mechanisms of prolactin receptor regulation may be an important determinant of the nature of the responses of a target tissue to prolactin.\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Soboleva et al. present a mathematical model of the prolactin-prolactin receptor signalling pathway (see figure below).  Model simulations demonstrate that while prolactin receptor expression is insensitive to subcutaneous injections of prolactin, it does however respond to a prolonged infusion of prolactin.  Under these latter conditions there is an initial acute period of receptor down-regulation followed by a prolonged period of up-regulation. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical modelling of prolactin-receptor interaction and the corollary for prolactin receptor gene expression in skin, T.K.

The model runs in both PCEnv and COR but the simulation results may deviate slightly from those which are published in the original paper.  We were unsure about the initial conditions used so where we were unsure we set everything to an initial concentration of 0.01 micromolar.  Furthermore, where the paper clearly states that Michaelis Menten kinetics were used for the methylation reactions, and Vmax and KR appear in the equations, values for these parameters were not provided.  We have derived these values from k1a, k1b and k1c (etc.) but we must highlight that these values may be incorrect.  All the units have been checked and are consistent. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nIn 1997, Peter A. Spiro, John S. Parkinson and Hans G. Othmer published a mathematical model which examined the mechanisms of excitation and adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis (see the figure below).  Chemotaxis is the process by which a cell alters its speed or frequency of turning in response to an extracellular chemical stimulus.  It is an example of a signal transduction pathway, with features of extreme sensitivity, signal amplification and adaptation: bacteria only respond to changes in their environment rather than to the absolute state of their environment.\n\n\nIn their model, Peter A. Spiro, John S. Parkinson and Hans G. Othmer describe how the phosphorylation cascade and signal amplification account for the extreme bacterial sensitivity to stimuli and how the receptor's multiple methylation states allow adaptation to occur. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model of excitation and adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, Peter A.

PubMed ID: 9207079\n\n\nIn CellML, models are thought of as connected networks of discrete components. These components may correspond to physiologically separated regions or chemically distinct objects, or may be useful modelling abstractions. This model has 61 components representing chemically distinct objects (23 chemical species and 38 reactions) and one component defined for modelling convenience which stores the universal variable time.  Because this model has so many components, its CellML rendering would be complex.  For an example of a CellML rendering of a reaction pathway see The Bhalla Iyengar EGF Pathway Model, 1999.  \n",

The units have been checked and are consistent. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT:  A novel topology of regulatory networks abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle is studied by constructing a simple nonlinear model. A ternary positive feedback loop with only positive regulations is constructed with elements that activates the subsequent element in a clockwise fashion. A ternary negative feedback loop with only negative regulations is constructed with the elements that inhibit the subsequent element in an anticlockwise fashion. Positive feedback loop exhibits bistability, whereas the negative feedback loop exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The novelty of the topology is that the corresponding elements in these two homogeneous feedback loops are linked by the binary positive feedback loops with only positive regulations. This results in the emergence of mixed feedback loops in the network that displays complex behaviour like the coexistence of multiple steady states, relaxation oscillations and chaos. Importantly, the arrangement of the feedback loops brings in the notion of checkpoint in the model. The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates ternary positive feedback loop, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\nA minimal mathematical model combining several regulatory cycles from the budding yeast cell cycle, K.

Once the model author loads the original model onto their website (found here) we'll check the CellML code against this original version and will hopefully be able to fix the CellML model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nSince it is impossible to directly measure the activity of the circadian pacemaker in humans, alternative markers of the circadian rhythms must be used, such as plasma melatonin, core body temperature and cortisol levels.  Of these markers, it has been demonstrated that plasma melatonin is the most reliable, and its presence in both blood and saliva makes it more accessible for assay.  Furthermore, unlike cortisol melatonin is relatively unaffected by sleep-wake state.\n\n\nSeveral mathematical models of circadian rhythms have been developed based on plasma melatonin data.  These employ a number of different methods to estimate circadian phase and amplitude from the measured melatonin data.  However, the accuracy of these methods comes into question since melatonin levels can be subject to inter-individual variation and can also be influenced by environmental factors - especially light.  Furthermore, the underlying physiology of melatonin secretion and clearance is often ignored.\n\n\nIn the study described here, Melissa St Hilaire et al. address these issues by developing a physiologically based mathematical model of melatonin, including ocular light suppression and interactions with the circadian pacemaker.  Their model is an extension of the previously published model of melatonin rhythms by Brown et al. (also described in CellML).  A saliva component has been added, and the effect of light on melatonin levels has been incorporated into the model by including equations based on those published by Kronauer et al.. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA physiologically based mathematical model of melatonin including ocular light suppression and interactions with the circadian pacemaker, Melissa A.

Mitogenesis is initiated when growth factors bind to specific receptor-kinases on the cell surface, triggering a signal transduction pathway involving reversible protein phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases.     \n\n\nIn this 1990 study, Starbuck et al. propose that growth factor receptors are responsible for triggering the signal transduction cascade by receiving an extracellular signal (the specific growth factor molecules), and converting this stimulus into the cascade via activation of the receptor kinase and subsequent protein phosphorylation and activation.  In addition, the receptor kinase is also able to phosphorylate other key proteins in the signal pathway.  The authors argue that a quantitative understanding of the receptor dynamics is essential for the understanding of the control of mammalian cell growth.  \n\n\nTo this end they develop a mathematical model of epidermal growth factor binding and trafficking dynamics in fibroblasts.  The figure below illustrates the surface and intracellular events which are included in the mathematical model.  The ligand (Lo) binds to its receptor on the cell surface (Rs) to form a ligand-receptor complex (Cs).  One of two possible pathways can then be taken:\n\nIn the first pathway, the ligand-receptor complex migrates in the plane of the cell surface membrane to cluster in specialised regions of the membrane called clathrin-coated pits.  Here, the complexes bind to the coated-pit proteins (Ps) to form ternary complexes (Ts), which are then internalised (Ti).\nIn the second pathway, the ligand-receptor complex is internalised as it is, without forming a ternary complex with pit-proteins (Cic).\n\nThe mathematical model to describe this process consists of a series of kinetic equations which describe the binding, internalisation and recycling of epidermal growth factor and its receptor, together with a simple expression which relates the dependence of the cell cycle progression on the receptor dynamics.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nEpidermal Growth Factor Binding and Trafficking Dynamics in Fibroblasts: Relationship to Cell Proliferation, Cindy Starbuck, H.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This model runs in OpenCell and COR, and the units are consistent throughout. The current model only describes a single RyR gating scheme, while the paper tests different gating schemes coupled with other dyadic components to recreate ion flows. As these are not described in great depth, this model is likely to remain incomplete and unable to recreate published results. Initial conditions used here are guesses. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: In cardiac muscle, release of activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs by calcium-induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are clustered in a dense, regular, two-dimensional lattice array at the diad junction. We simulated numerically the stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four putative RyR gating schemes based on single-channel measurements in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation-contraction coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background calcium. If the ryanodine receptor was represented, instead, by a phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting from simultaneous binding of two Ca2+ ions, and either calcium-dependent or activation-linked inactivation, the simulations gave a good semiquantitative accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation-contraction coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of the foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation during evolution.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nLocal Control Models of Cardiac Excitation-Contraction Coupling A Possible Role for Allosteric Interactions between Ryanodine Receptors, Michael D.

In the present paper, the results obtained with this model are described in more detail. For different values of biologically interpretable parameters, the model predicts very different patterns of CD4+ T-cell decline after primary infection. With the assumption of a variability of 10% to 25% of three parameters between infected individuals, the model yields a realistic distribution curve of the incubation period to AIDS. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAnalysis of a model for the pathogenesis of AIDS, Stilianakis NI, Dietz K, and Schenzle D, 1997,\n            Mathematical Biosciences, 145, 27-46.

The 'switches' described in Table 1 of the paper have not been implemented in this CellML description.

Positive feedbacks are created by Cdc13/Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of specific substrates: inactivating its negative regulators (Rum1, Ste9 and Wee1/Mik1) and activating its positive regulator (Cdc25). A slow negative feedback loop is turned on during mitosis by activation of Slp1/anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which indirectly re-activates the negative regulators, leading to a drop in Cdc13/Cdc2 activity and exit from mitosis.\n\t\t\t\t\nThe model explains how fission yeast cells can exit mitosis in the absence of Ste9 (Cdc13 degradation) and Rum1 (an inhibitor of Cdc13/Cdc2). We also show that, if the positive feedback loops accelerating the G2/M transition (through Wee1 and Cdc25) are weak, then cells can reset back to G2 from early stages of mitosis by premature activation of the negative feedback loop. This resetting can happen more than once, resulting in a quantized distribution of cycle times, as observed experimentally in wee1  -   cdc25delta mutant cells. Our quantitative description of these quantized cycles demonstrates the utility of mathematical modeling, because these cycles cannot be understood by intuitive arguments alone.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\nModeling the fission yeast cell cycle: Quantized cycle\ntimes in wee12- cdc25 mutant cells, Akos Sveiczer, Attila Csikasz-Nagi, Bela Gyorffy, John J.

The general shape of the simulation output seems correct (figure 1), however the scale is not the same as the figure in the published paper.\nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an enzyme produced by both normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Although PSA is the most widely used serum marker to detect and follow patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, there are certain anomalies in the values of serum levels of PSA that are not understood. We developed a mathematical model for the dynamics of serum levels of PSA as a function of the tumor volume. Our model results show good agreement with experimental observations and provide an explanation for the existence of significant prostatic tumor mass despite a low-serum PSA. This result can be very useful in enhancing the use of serum PSA levels as a marker for cancer growth.\nThe original paper is cited below:\nA Quantitative Model for the Dynamics of Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen as a Marker for Cancerous Growth, Kristin R.

For the alternative model which has the A-type current switched on and the BK-type potassium current switched off (gBK=0.2).

Please note that the model needs to be run for at least 3000ms to allow the model to reach stability.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations ~1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both I BK and I A could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. I BK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while I A could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that a heterogeneous distribution of fast K+ conductances could cause heterogeneous lactotroph firing patterns.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLow dose of dopamine may stimulate prolactin secretion by increasing fast potassium currents, Joel Tabak, Natalia Toporikova, Marc E.

Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA model for human ventricular tissue, K.H.W.J. ten Tusscher, D.

However despite their prevalance, they remain relatively poorly understood.  Mathematical models, which capture the function of the beating human heart, play an important role in cardiac research.  In part this is because practical experiments on human hearts are limited, and animal hearts may differ significantly in their anatomy and physiology relative to the human heart.  In addition, cardiac arrhythmias are three dimensional phenomena, while experimental observations are mainly limited to surface recordings.\n\n\nExisting mathematical models of human ventricular cells include:\n\n\nPriebe and Beuckelmann, Electrophysiological Model of the Human Ventricular Myocyte, 1998; and\n\nBernus et al.

A stimulus protocol has been added that allows the model to simulate multiple action potentials at 1Hz.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the main causes of death in the Western world. According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the slope of the APD restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell model, which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human heart.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAlternans and spiral breakup in a human ventricular tissue model, K.H.W.J. ten Tusscher, A.V.

The formalization of this process for computational modelling is facilitated by the use of accepted standards with which to describe and simulate models, ensuring consistency between the models and thus reducing the development and propagation of errors. CellML 1.1, an XML-based programming language, has been designed as a modelling standard which, by virtue of its import and grouping functions, facilitates model combination and reuse. Using CellML 1.1, we demonstrate the process of formalized model reuse by combining three separate models of rat cardiomyocyte function (an electrophysiology model, a model of cellular calcium dynamics and a mechanics model) which together make up the Pandit-Hinch-Niederer et al. cell model. Not only is this integrative model of rat electromechanics a useful tool for cardiac modelling but it is also an ideal framework with which to demonstrate both the power of model reuse and the challenges associated with this process. We highlight and classify a number of these issues associated with combining models and provide some suggested solutions.\n\n\nUsing Physiome standards to couple cellular functions for rat cardiac excitation-contraction, Jonna R.

This particular CellML model is based on a Matlab file which, in turn, was exported from the working SBML file in the BioModels database.  There are several subtle differences between the published paper and the working Matlab code which have been previously documented by the BioModels curators.  In brief these are:\n\t\t\tin the kinetic law for ADH the species a should denote NAD and b Ethanol the last term in the equation should read bpq/(Kib Kiq Kp) and the rate equation for the PFK contains two errors: the R term should read: R = 1 + lambda1 + lambda2 + gR lambda1 lambda2 and the last term in the L equation should be squared.\n\t\t\tAlso there are slight differences in the parameterisation of the model depending on whether it comes from the JWS or the BioModels database and, for Vmax values, please note that there is a conversion factor of approxinately 270 to convert from U/mg-protein as shown in Table 1 of the paper to mmol/(min*L_cytosol).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: This paper examines whether the in vivo behavior of yeast glycolysis can be understood in terms of the in vitro kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes. In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n\t\t\t\tThis CellML model runs in PCenv and OpenCell to recreate the published results, but not COR because of the presence of the modulo operator. The maximum step size must be constrained to be 0.001 weeks or smaller, or the software will ignore the pulsatile administration of gemcitabine. This model describes the response of tumor size to administration of gemcitabine, and was based off original Berkeley Madonna code provided by the model authors.  \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: PURPOSE: This tumor response pharmacodynamic model aims to describe primary lesion shrinkage in non-small cell lung cancer over time and determine if concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine or that of its metabolites, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine or gemcitabine triphosphate, are better than gemcitabine dose for prediction of individual response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma gemcitabine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model. RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8 week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored doses of drug administered to patients. Modeling tumor shrinkage in primary lesions can be used to quantify individual sensitivity and response to antitumor effects of anticancer drugs.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA pharmacodynamic model for the time course of tumor shrinkage by gemcitabine + carboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer patients, Lai-San Tham, Lingzhi Wang, Ross A Soo, Soo-Chin Lee, How-Sung Lee, Wei-Peng Yong, Boon-Cher Goh and Nicholas H.G.

Several parameters and initial values were also corrected from Version 01. The concentrations for D (agonist) and R (receptor) were not stated in the paper and were set to 10^-8 and 10^-9 molar (reference: Nicholas Le Novere, BioModels). This file is known to run in PCEnv and will probably run in COR, although this has not been confirmed. Because of the nature of the figures presented in the paper, it is difficult to validate the output of this model.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nG-proteins, or guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, serve to couple receptors to membrane-bound enzymes such as adenylate cyclase. In turn this induces the generation of secondary messengers such as cAMP for purposes of signal transduction. The inactive form of the G-protein consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with a molecule of GDP bound to the alpha subunit. When a ligand-bound receptor interacts with the G-protein, it catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP and activates the G-protein. The G-protein is then released from the receptor and it dissociates into separate beta-gamma and alpha-GTP (active) subunits. Active G-proteins are returned to their inactive state upon the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha-subunit and the alpha-GDP and beta-gamma subunits can recombine. (See the figure below).\n\n\nThis description of a general G-protein activation pathway is based on the mathematical model described by W.J Thomsen and R.R. Neubig in their 1989 paper. The model does not include the steps of dissociation and recombination of the alpha and beta-gamma subunits of the G-protein. In addition, it is assumed that the number of membrane bound receptors (Rt) is constant. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRapid kinetics of alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

PubMed ID: 2574993\n\n\nIn CellML, models are thought of as connected networks of discrete components. These components may correspond to physiologically separated regions or chemically distinct objects, or may be useful modelling abstractions. This pathway model has 17 components representing chemically distinct objects (11 chemical species and six reactions) and one component for modelling convenience in which global variables such as time are declared. The CellML rendering of the G-protein activation pathway model is shown in  (the different shapes in the diagram are explained in the notation guide). The action of a catalyst on a reaction is again represented by dashed lines. \n",

We show that interactions between the oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute significance only. It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin infusion produce similar effects. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModelling the Insulin-Glucose Feedback System: The Significance of Pulsatile Insulin Secretion, Iva Marija Tolic, Erik Mosekilde and Jeppe Sturis, 2000, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 207, 361-375.

However, why and how Ca(2+) oscillation regulates NFAT activity remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation proceeds rapidly, while the rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly. Therefore, after brief Ca(2+) stimulation, dephosphorylated NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus, Ca(2+) oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation, provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca(2+) oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of Ca(2+) signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation at a reduced cost of Ca(2+) signaling.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\nNFAT functions as a working memory of Ca2+ signals in decoding Ca2+ oscillation, Taichiro Tomida, Kenzo Hirose, Azusa Takizawa, Futoshi Shibasaki and Masamitsu Iino, 2003,  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe EMBO Journal, 22, 3825-3832.

We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for thirteen ionic currents of USMCs: Ca2+ currents (L- and T-type), Na+ current, and hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated K+ currents, Ca2+ -activated K+ current,Ca2+ -activated Cl- current, non-specific cation current, Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger, Na+ -K+ pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area:volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular Ca2+ computed from known Ca2+ fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modelled in relation to the time constant of changing [Ca2+ ]i . This integrated model is validated by its reconstruction of the different action potential configurations of USMCs (spikes,plateau and bursts of spikes), the change from bursting to plateau type AP produced by estradiol, and of simultaneous experimental recordings of spontaneous AP, [Ca2+ ]i and phasic force. In summary, our advanced mathematical model provides a powerful tool to investigate the physiological ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of uterine electrical excitation-contraction coupling of labor and parturition. This will furnish the evolution of descriptive and predictive quantitative models of myometrial electrogenesis at the whole cell and tissue levels.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA computational model of the ionic currents, Ca2+ dynamics and action potentials underlying contraction of isolated uterine smooth muscle.

The model can be run in both OpenCell (version 0.8) and OpenCOR (version 0.4) environments using any of the integration methods. To recreate the published results, for example figure 7 from the original paper, apply a suitable stimulating current and integrate the model for a total 60 sec with a time step of 0.02 ms. \n          \nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: The electrical excitability of uterine smooth muscle cells is a key determinant of the contraction of the organ during labor and is manifested by spontaneous, periodic action potentials (APs). Near the end of term, APs vary in shape and size reflecting an ability to change the frequency, duration and amplitude of uterine contractions. A recent mathematical model (PubMed ID: 21559514, CellML model) quantified several ionic features of the electrical excitability in uterine smooth muscle cells. It replicated many of the experimentally recorded uterine AP configurations but its limitations were evident when trying to simulate the long-duration bursting APs characteristic of labor. A computational parameter search suggested that delayed rectifying K+ currents could be a key model component requiring improvement to produce the longer-lasting bursting APs. Of the delayed rectifying K+ currents family it is of interest that KCNQ and hERG channels have been reported to be gestationally regulated in the uterus. These currents exhibit features similar to the broadly defined uterine IK1 of the original mathematical model. We thus formulated new quantitative descriptions for several IKCNQ and IhERG. Incorporation of these currents into the uterine cell model enabled simulations of the long-lasting bursting APs. Moreover, we used this modified model to simulate the effects of different contributions of IKCNQ and IhERG on AP form. Our findings suggest that the alterations in expression of hERG and KCNQ channels can potentially provide a mechanism for fine tuning of AP forms that lends a malleability for changing between plateau-like and long-lasting bursting-type APs as uterine cells prepare for parturition.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nComputational modeling reveals key contributions of KCNQ and hERG currents to the malleability of uterine action potentials underpinning labor.

The primary variables of this system are beta-cell mass, plasma insulin concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. Existing mathematical models of glucose regulation incorporate only glucose and/or insulin dynamics. Here we develop a novel model of beta-cell mass, insulin, and glucose dynamics, which consists of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where glucose and insulin dynamics are fast relative to beta-cell mass dynamics. For normal parameter values, the model has two stable fixed points (representing physiological and pathological steady states), separated on a slow manifold by a saddle point. Mild hyperglycemia leads to the growth of the beta-cell mass (negative feedback) while extreme hyperglycemia leads to the reduction of the beta-cell mass (positive feedback). The model predicts that there are three pathways in prolonged hyperglycemia: (1) the physiological fixed point can be shifted to a hyperglycemic level (regulated hyperglycemia), (2) the physiological and saddle points can be eliminated (bifurcation), and (3) progressive defects in glucose and/or insulin dynamics can drive glucose levels up at a rate faster than the adaptation of the beta-cell mass which can drive glucose levels down (dynamical hyperglycemia).\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Model of Beta-cell Mass, Insulin, and Glucose Kinetics: Pathways to Diabetes, Brian Topp, Keith Promislow, Gerda de Vries, Robert M.

Our model, based on the Rice et al. (2008) model of cross-bridge kinetics, reproduces many of the observed effects of MgATP, MgADP, Pi and H+ on force development while still retaining the force/length/Ca2+ properties of the original model. We introduce three new parameters to account for the competitive binding of H+ to the Ca2+ binding site on troponin C and the binding of MgADP within the cross-bridge cycle. These parameters along with the Pi and H+ regulatory steps within the cross-bridge cycle were constrained using data from the literature and validated using a range of metabolic and sinusoidal length perturbation protocols. The placement of the MgADP binding step between two strongly-bound and force-generating states leads to the emergence of an unexpected effect on the force-MgADP curve, where the trend of the relationship (positive or negative) depends on the concentrations of the other metabolites and [H+]. The model is used to investigate the sensitivity of maximum force production to changes in metabolite concentrations during the development of ischemia. \n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA metabolite-sensitive, thermodynamically-constrained model of cardiac cross-bridge cycling: Implications for force development during ischemia, Kenneth Tran, Nicolas P.

This particular version of the CellML model describes the three-state cooperative SERCA model and recreates figure 13.  In order to recreate this figure we have had to add an additional equation to the model to define the rate of change in Casr.  Please also note there are typographical errors in the original paper and [H+] should be raised to the power of n (n=2) for T_Hi and T_Hsr. Also in figure 12 the concentrations of ADP should be 8uM and 20uM rather than 20uM and 40uM.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We present a biophysically based kinetic model of the cardiac SERCA pump that consolidates a range of experimental data into a consistent and thermodynamically constrained framework. The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca(2+) and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca(2+)-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca(2+)/H(+) counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data. A thermodynamic investigation of the model indicates that the binding of MgATP has a large inhibitory effect on the maximal reverse rate of the pump. The model is suitable for integrating into whole-cell models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to simulate the effects on the cell of compromised metabolism arising in ischemia and hypoxia.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Thermodynamic Model of the Cardiac Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Ca(2+) (SERCA) Pump, Kenneth Tran, Nicolas P.

Our model, based on the Rice et al. (2008) model of cross-bridge kinetics, reproduces many of the observed effects of MgATP, MgADP, Pi and H+ on force development while still retaining the force/length/Ca2+ properties of the original model. We introduce three new parameters to account for the competitive binding of H+ to the Ca2+ binding site on troponin C and the binding of MgADP within the cross-bridge cycle. These parameters along with the Pi and H+ regulatory steps within the cross-bridge cycle were constrained using data from the literature and validated using a range of metabolic and sinusoidal length perturbation protocols. The placement of the MgADP binding step between two strongly-bound and force-generating states leads to the emergence of an unexpected effect on the force-MgADP curve, where the trend of the relationship (positive or negative) depends on the concentrations of the other metabolites and [H+]. The model is used to investigate the sensitivity of maximum force production to changes in metabolite concentrations during the development of ischemia. \n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA metabolite-sensitive, thermodynamically-constrained model of cardiac cross-bridge cycling: Implications for force development during ischemia, Kenneth Tran, Nicolas P.

This is the control version of the experiment.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Drug biotransformation is one of the most important parameters of preclinical screening tests for the registration of new drug candidates. Conventional existing tests rely on nonhuman models which deliver an incomplete metabolic profile of drugs due to the lack of proper CYP450 expression as seen in human liver in vivo. In order to overcome this limitation, we used an organotypical model of human primary hepatocytes for the biotransformation of the drug diazepam with special reference to metabolites in both the cell matrix phase and supernatant and its interaction of three inducers (phenobarbital, dexamethasone, aroclor 1254) in different time responses (1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h). Phenobarbital showed the strongest inducing effect in generating desmethyldiazepam and induced up to a 150 fold increase in oxazepam-content which correlates with the increased availability of the precursor metabolites (temazepam and desmethyldiazepam). Aroclor 1254 and dexamethasone had the strongest inducing effect on temazepam and the second strongest on oxazepam. The strong and overlapping inductive role of phenobarbital strengthens the participation of CYP2B6 and CYP3A in diazepam N-demethylation and CYP3A in temazepam formation. Aroclor 1254 preferentially generated temazepam due to the interaction with CYP3A and potentially CYP2C19. In parallel we represented these data in the form of a mathematical model with two compartments explaining the dynamics of diazepam metabolism with the effect of these other inducers in human primary hepatocytes. The model consists of ten differential equations, with one for each concentration c(i,j) (i=diazepam, temazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, other metabolites) and one for each compartment (j= cell matrix phase, supernatant), respectively. The parameters p(k) (k=1, 2, 3, 4, 13) are rate constants describing the biotransformation of diazepam and its metabolites and the other parameters (k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) explain the concentration changes in the two compartments.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n         Two compartment model of diazepam biotransformation in an organotypical culture of primary human hepatocytes, Ali Acikgoz et al, 2009, Toxicology and applied pharmacology, 234, 179-191.

Under constant conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms persist with a period close to 1 day (\"circadian\"), but it is usually not exactly 24 h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes. Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form (phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Simple Model of Circadian Rhythms Based on Dimerization and Proteolysis of PER and TIM, John J.

After the discovery of per and tim, a model with a simple feedback loop involving per and tim has been proposed. However, it is recognized that the simple feedback model cannot account for phenotypes generated by various mutants. A recent report by Glossop, Lyons and Hardin [Science286, 766 (1999)] on Drosophila suggests involvement of another feedback loop by dClk that is interlocked with per-tim feedback loop. In order to examine whether interlocked feedback loops can be a basic mechanism for circadian rhythms, a mathematical model was created and examined. Through extensive simulation and mathematical analysis, it was revealed that the interlocked feedback model accounts for the observations that are not explained by the simple feedback model. Moreover, the interlocked feedback model has robust properties in oscillations.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRobust oscillations within the interlocked feedback model of Drosophila circadian rhythm, Hiroki R.

This CellML model can reproduce the top graph in figure 2 of the original publication.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: Computational models of a large metabolic system can be assembled from modules that represent a biological function emerging from interaction of a small subset of molecules. A \"skeleton model\" is tested here for a module that regulates the first phase of dynamic adaptation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to demand in heart muscle cells. The model contains only diffusion, mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeation, and two isoforms of creatine kinase (CK), in cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), respectively. The communication with two neighboring modules occurs via stimulation of mitochondrial ATP production by ADP and P(i) from the IMS and via time-varying cytosolic ATP hydrolysis during contraction. Assuming normal cytosolic diffusion and high MOM permeability for ADP, the response time of OxPhos (t(mito); generalized time constant) to steps in cardiac pacing rate is predicted to be 2.4 s. In contrast, with low MOM permeability, t(mito) is predicted to be 15 s. An optimized MOM permeability of 21 micromolar/s gives t(mito) = 3.7 s, in agreement with experiments on rabbit heart with blocked glycolytic ATP synthesis. The model correctly predicts a lower t(mito) if CK activity is reduced by 98%. Among others, the following predictions result from the model analysis: 1) CK activity buffers large ADP oscillations; 2) ATP production is pulsatile in beating heart, although it adapts slowly to demand with \"time constant\" approximately 14 heartbeats; 3) if the muscle isoform of CK is overexpressed, OxPhos reacts slower to changing workload; and 4) if mitochondrial CK is overexpressed, OxPhos reacts faster.         \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAdenine nucleotide-creatine-phosphate module in myocardial metabolic system explains fast phase of dynamic regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, Johannes H.G.M. van Beek, 2007, American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology, 293, C815-C829.

Although it is a accurate reproduction of the published model it does not recreate the published results. Although the steady state values for some parameters are similar to published results, the model does not recreate the bursting seen in the paper and a stimulus protocl might need to be added. \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: In GnRH-secreting (GT1) neurons, activation of Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors induces a sustained membrane depolarization that shifts the profile of the action potential (AP) waveform from sharp, high-amplitude to broad, low-amplitude spikes. Here we characterize this shift in the firing pattern and its impact on Ca(2+) influx experimentally by using prerecorded sharp and broad APs as the voltage-clamp command pulse. As a quantitative test of the experimental data, a mathematical model based on the membrane and ionic current properties of GT1 neurons was also used. Both experimental and modeling results indicated that inactivation of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) channels by sustained depolarization accounted for a reduction in the amplitude of the spike upstroke. The ensuing decrease in tetraethylammonium-sensitive K(+) current activation slowed membrane repolarization, leading to AP broadening. This change in firing pattern increased the total L-type Ca(2+) current and facilitated AP-driven Ca(2+) entry. The leftward shift in the current-voltage relation of the L-type Ca(2+) channels expressed in GT1 cells allowed the depolarization-induced AP broadening to facilitate Ca(2+) entry despite a decrease in spike amplitude. Thus the gating properties of the L-type Ca(2+) channels expressed in GT1 neurons are suitable for promoting AP-driven Ca(2+) influx in receptor- and non-receptor-depolarized cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAmplitude-Dependent Spike-Broadening and Enhanced Ca2+ Signaling in GnRH-Secreting Neurons, Fredrick Van Goor, Andrew P.

We are continuing to work on the model. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\nModel Structure\n\nMetabolic networks are highly complex nonlinear reaction systems whose functions are tightly co-ordinated and regulated by feedback mechanisms to meet the physiological demands of living organisms.  Dynamic mathematical models of metabolic networks allow prediction as to how metabolism will respond to manipulation.\n\n\nThe pentose phosphate pathway can provide an alternative to glycolysis plus the TCA cycle for the complete oxidation of glucose.  However, it is thought that its main role is not glucose oxidation, but to provide the cell with a source of NADPH for biosynthetic reactions and to supply pentose phosphate for the synthesis of nucleotides.\n\n\nIn 1999, Sam Vaseghi, Anja Baumeister, Manfred Rizzi and Matthias Reuss published a kinetic model of the pentose phosphate pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see  below).  They studied the in vivo dynamics of the pathway under conditions of continuous culture in order to elucidate important regulation phenomena responsible for co-ordinating the fluxes between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.  They constructed the model by combining knowledge about enzyme kinetics with the stoichiometry of metabolic pathways based on the same principles used by Rizzi et al in their model of glycolysis (1997) (see The Glycolysis Pathway Model, 1997). \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nIn Vivo Dynamics of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n, Sam Vaseghi, Anja Baumeister, Manfred Rizzi and Matthias Reuss, 1999, \nMetabolic Engineering\n, 1, 128-140.  (A PDF version of the article is available to subscribers on the Metabolic Engineering website.)  PubMed ID: 10935926\n\n\nThe raw CellML description of the pentose phosphate pathway model can be downloaded in various formats as described in .  For an example of a more complete documentation of another real reaction pathway, see The Bhalla Iyengar EGF Pathway Model, 1999. \n\n\nIn CellML, models are thought of as connected networks of discrete components. These components may correspond to physiologically separated regions or chemically distinct objects, or may be useful modelling abstractions. This model has 36 components representing chemically distinct objects (15 metabolites, 10 enzymes one inhibitor and 10 reactions) and one component defined for modelling convenience which stores the universal variable time.  Because this model has so many components, its CellML rendering would be complex.  For an example of a CellML rendering of a reaction pathway see The Bhalla Iyengar EGF Pathway Model, 1999.  \n",

However the model contains partial differential equations which are currently beyond the scope of the CellML API.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to investigate theoretically which intracellular factors may be important for regulation of mitochondrial respiration in working heart cells in vivo. We have developed a model that describes quantitatively the published experimental data on dependence of the rate of oxygen consumption and metabolic state of working isolated perfused rat heart on workload over its physiological range (Williamson JR, Ford G, Illingworth J, Safer B. Circ Res 38, Suppl I, I39-I51, 1976). Analysis of this model shows that for phosphocreatine, creatine, and ATP the equilibrium assumption is an acceptable approximation with respect to their diffusion in the intracellular bulk water phase. However, the ADP concentration changes in the contraction cycle in a nonequilibrium workload-dependent manner, showing the existence of the intracellular concentration gradients. The model shows that workload-dependent alteration of ADP concentration in the compartmentalized creatine kinase system may be taken, together with the changes in P(i) concentration, to be among the major components of the metabolic feedback signal for regulation of respiration in muscle cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nRegulation of mitochondrial respiration in heart cells analyzed by reaction-diffusion model of energy transfer, Marko Vendelin, Olav Kongas, and Valdur Saks, 2000,             American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology, 278, C747-C764.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n            This CellML model has been checked in both PCEnv and COR and the model runs in both to recreate figure 5A in the paper.  This particular version of the model describes a two-compartment model of receptor trafficking for one ligand.  The equations have been written to look like those in figure 4 of the paper.  Initial conditions were not provided in the paper so were taken from the SBML model in the BioModels database (BIOMD0000000101).  Also note that the model only runs correctly if time in minutes is defined as 3600s, and the ligand concentration is increased from 3E-5 to 0.01 at time t=2500 to ensure that the system reaches steady state. Hence, the time t=0 of the paper corresponds to t=2500 in the model (alo in accordance with the SBML model).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: The TGF-beta pathway plays a central role in tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis. It transduces a variety of extracellular signals into intracellular transcriptional responses that control a plethora of cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. We use computational modeling to show that coupling of signaling with receptor trafficking results in a highly versatile signal-processing unit, able to sense by itself absolute levels of ligand, temporal changes in ligand dimensionless, and ratios of multiple ligands. This coupling controls whether the response of the receptor module is transient or permanent and whether or not different signaling channels behave independently of each other. Our computational approach unifies seemingly disparate experimental observations and suggests specific changes in receptor trafficking patterns that can lead to phenotypes that favor tumor progression.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSignal processing in the TGF-beta superfamily ligand-receptor network, Jose M.

Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these \"circuits\" at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. and Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267-268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMechanisms of noise-resistance in genetic oscillators, Jose M.

The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of IKr and IKs on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of IKs density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced IKs (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of IKs activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, INaCa, secondary to Na+ accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of IKs:IKr density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEffects of IKr and IKs heterogeneity on action potential duration and its rate dependence: a simulation study, Prakash C.

Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor initiates signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding kinetics. Interestingly, negative cooperative interactions are observed at high insulin concentrations while positive cooperativity may be present at low insulin concentrations. Clearly, insulin receptor binding kinetics cannot be simply explained by a classical bimolecular reaction. Mature insulin receptors have a dimeric structure capable of binding two molecules of insulin. The binding affinity of the receptor for the second insulin molecule is significantly lower than for the first bound insulin molecule. In addition, insulin receptor aggregation occurs in response to ligand binding and aggregation may also influence binding kinetics. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for insulin receptor binding kinetics that explicitly represents the divalent nature of the insulin receptor and incorporates receptor aggregation into the kinetic model. Model parameters are based upon published data where available. Computer simulations with our model are capable of reproducing both negative and positive cooperativity at the appropriate insulin concentrations. This model may be a useful tool for helping to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding and the coupling of receptor binding to downstream signaling events. \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nInsulin receptor binding kinetics: modeling and simulation studies, Sumanas Wanant and Michael J.

Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated cross-talk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from cross-talk, PI3K enhances Erk activation at points both upstream and downstream of Ras. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras/Erk activation.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nPI3K-dependent cross-talk interactions converge with Ras as quantifiable inputs integrated by Erk, Wang CC, Cirit M, and Haugh JM, 2009, Molecular Systems Biology, 5, article 246.

The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the Ca(2+) oscillations are mainly due to interaction of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump back into the ER, and the oscillations are prolonged by extracellular Ca(2+) entry that maintains the constant Ca(2+) supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca(2+) oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca(2+) oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca(2+)](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca(2+) oscillations in different types of cells.\n        \n\n\tThe original paper is cited below:\n\t\n\n\tA quantitative kinetic model for ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.

In this study, we investigated the effects of riluzole on ion currents in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs). Western blotting revealed the protein expression of greek small letter alpha-subunits for both large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel and Na+ channel (Nav1.5) in these cells. Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous beating in dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2.3 uM. Riluzole (10 uM) also effectively increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) which could be reversed by iberiotoxin (200 nM) and paxilline (1 uM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out patches, when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10 uM) increased BKCa-channel activity with a decrease in mean closed time. Simulation studies also unraveled that both decreased conductance of INa and increased conductance of IK(Ca) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in skeletal muscle cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action potentials and increase the repolarization of action potentials. Taken together, inhibition of INa and stimulation of BKCa-channel activity caused by this drug are partly, if not entirely, responsible for its muscle relaxant actions in clinical setting. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nEffect of riluzole on action potential in cultured human skeletal muscle cells, Ya-Jean Wang, Ming-Wei Lin, An-An Lin, Sheng-Nan Wu, 2007, Life Sciences, 82, 11-20.

The dramatic differences in action potential (AP) shape between neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes, however, indicate that a different set of molecular interactions in neonatal myocytes necessitates different treatment for newborns. Computational modeling is useful for synthesizing data to determine how interactions between components lead to systems-level behavior, but this technique has not been used extensively to study neonatal heart cell function. We created a mathematical model of the neonatal (day 1) mouse myocyte by modifying, on the basis of experimental data, the densities and/or formulations of ion transport mechanisms in an adult cell model. The new model reproduces the characteristic AP shape of neonatal cells, with a brief plateau phase and longer duration than the adult (action potential duration at 80% repolarization = 60.1 vs. 12.6 ms). The simulation results are consistent with experimental data, including 1) decreased density and altered inactivation of transient outward K+ currents, 2) increased delayed rectifier K+ currents, 3) Ca2+ entry through T-type as well as L-type Ca2+ channels, 4) increased Ca2+ influx through Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and 5) Ca2+ transients resulting from transmembrane Ca2+ entry rather than release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Simulations performed with the model generated novel predictions, including increased SR Ca2+ leak and elevated intracellular Na+ concentration in neonatal compared with adult myocytes. This new model can therefore be used for testing hypotheses and obtaining a better quantitative understanding of differences between neonatal and adult physiology.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n          Mathematical model of the neonatal mouse ventricular action potential, Linda J.

In order to fully describe the original model it would be necessary to create 6 different compartments and then decribe the diffusion of calcium between these.  Further there are other parameter values which are missing.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: We constructed a chromaffin cell model for analysis of stimulation-secretion coupling in computer simulation studies. The model includes mechanisms involved in the excitatory synapse, voltage-dependent Na(+), K(+) and Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SK type), buffered Ca(2+) diffusion, Ca(2+) extrusion, fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators and Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis. Calculations of the modeled mechanisms were carried out using the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, Neural Computation 9:1179-1209, 1997). A set of parameter values was determined so as to fit basic experimental results reported in the literature. The model was also applied to simulate our experimental results obtained from chromaffin cells in the perfused rat adrenal medulla. Observed profiles of Ca(2+)responses induced by electrically stimulating the splanchnic nerve with various frequencies (1-50 Hz) were adequately simulated with minor readjustments of parameter values for Ca(2+)influx and extrusion. Secretory responses measured at the same time as the Ca(2+)responses were also simulated with consideration of a time constant to detect catecholamines in the experiment. Similarly, model simulations reproduced both Ca(2+)responses and secretory responses evoked by elevations of the extracellular K(+) concentration for different periods. The results suggest that the presented model provides a useful tool for analyzing and predicting quantitative relations in various events occurring in stimulation-secretion coupling in chromaffin cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling of stimulation-secretion coupling in a chromaffin cell, A.

Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain calcium wave propagation: diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and diffusion of paracrine extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of airway epithelium to parametreize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a decreasing return on the radius of Ca2+ wave propagation is achieved as the amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore shown that for a Ca2+ wave to propagate large distances, a significant fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to be released. Further to this, the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional mechanism is important in Ca2+ wave propagation, such as regenerative release of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nMathematical modelling of calcium wave propagation in mammalian airway epithelium: evidence for regenerative ATP release, N.J.

The model has also been checked in COR and the units are consistent.  This particular version of the model has alpha set to 0.5 and therefore it represents wound healing in a healthy individual (figure 2, left hand column).\n          \nModel Structure\n\nWounds in diabetic patients can take much longer to heal than they would in a healthy individual; some taking up to 18 months to heal properly.  This suggests the normal wound healing process is disrupted in some way in diabetic patients, but despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying this process are still relatively poorly understood.  However, by piecing together the information which has been obtained, it is possible to develop a simple mathematical model of the wound healing process and how it is influenced by diabetes.  \n\n\nThe first stage of the wound healing process is inflammation, and macrophages are some of the first cells to be recruited to the site of injury.  They are derived from monocytes and they differentiate into one of three types depending on the chemical stimulus they receive, namely; cytocidal (or killer), inflammatory, and repair macrophages.  Killer macrophages remove bacteria and other debris from the wound site by phagocytosis, inflammatory macrophages secrete cytokines and chemokines to attract fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the wound and encourage their proliferation, while repair macrophages help to remodel the extracellular matrix of the wound.  The ratio of inflammatory to repair macrophages seems to be a key determinant of the rate of wound healing. \n\n\nIn diabetic patients cell proliferation is often impaired, endothelial cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis, blood glucose levels are elevated, blood vessel growth is impaired, and there can be decreased collagen deposition at the wound site.  Macrophage removal to the lymph nodes may also be impaired, which might explain the presence of macrophages at the wound site long after the inflammatory stage when they would have normally been cleared in a healthy individual. \n\n\nTo date, mathematical models of wound healing have tended to focus on the cell proliferation and repair stages of the wound process.  However, in diabetic patients it seems the inflammatory phase should be modelled instead.  In the paper described here, Helen Waugh and Jonathan Sherratt address this issue by developing a basic mathematical model of the inflammatory stage of the wound healing process, in particular focusing on the behaviour of the macrophage populations.  This model is discussed in the context of the available biological data, and simulations are also used to suggest potential treatment strategies.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMacrophage dynamics in diabetic wound dealing, Helen V.

Our work extends a previously developed model, which considers inflammatory and repair macrophage dynamics in normal and diabetic wound healing. Here, we extend the model to include equations for platelet-derived growth factor concentration, fibroblast density, collagen density, and hyaluronan concentration. This enables us to examine the variation of these components in both normal and diabetic wound healing cases, and to model the treatment protocols of these therapies. Within the context of our model, we find that the key component to successful healing in diabetic wounds is hyaluronan and that the therapies work by increasing the amount of hyaluronan available in the wound environment. The time-to-healing results correlate with those observed in clinical trials and the model goes some way to establishing an understanding of why diabetic wounds do not heal, and how these treatments affect the diabetic wound environment to promote wound closure.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling the effects of treating diabetic wounds with engineered skin substitutes, Helen V.

We would like to thank the author of the original model, Steven Webb, for making the original source code available to us.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nThe host immune response to a tumour can be divided into two basic, overlapping stages: the first is a phase of cell to cell recognition and interaction between the host lymphocytes and the target tumour cells, and this is followed by a stage of lymphocyte mediated killing of the tumour cells by apoptosis.  However, in an evolutionary arms race between the host immune system and the tumour, some tumour cells have developed various strategies to evade both stages of the host immune response.   \n\n\nOne of these strategies is for tumour cells to kill activated lymphocytes through their synthesis and secretion of the death ligand, FasL.  This ligand binds to the death receptor Fas (also known as CD95) which is expressed on the surface of the activated lymphocytes, and this interaction triggers the apoptotic pathway in the lymphocyte.  The binding of Fas and FasL can be controlled, at least in part, by the cleavage of FasL into a smaller, less cytotoxic, soluble form (sFasL) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).  In addition, certain cells are able to secrete sFasL by alternate splicing of Fas mRNA transcripts.  In combination, both these phenomena can lead to the down-regulation of the immune response.   \n\n\nTumour-immune cell dynamics have been the subject of several theoretical studies.  In the paper described here, Steven Webb, Jonathan Sherratt and Reginald Fish have developed a mathematical model of the Fas/FasL system to investigate Fas-FasL binding and the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis in the process of tumour-induced immunosupression.  Model simulations demonstrate how the constitutive expression of FasL by tumour cells is a potential mechanism of immune evasion, and the model predicts that sFasL can act as an inhibitor of the Fas death signal.  In addition the model considers the enzymatic cleavage of FasL into sFasL, and predicts that the inhibition of MMP cleavage activity causes Fas sensitive lymphocytes to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis faster than the Fas-resistant tumour cells.\n\n\nThe model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations which represent the binding of Fas and FasL for each cell type.  \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nCells behaving badly: a theoretical model for the Fas/FasL system in tumour immunology, Steven D.

The model incorporates two cell types (CD4+ T cells and a long-lived pool of cells), two strains of virus (drug-sensitive wild type and drug-resistant mutant) and two types of antiretroviral agents (reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors). The transient behavior of the cells and virus and the eventual eradication of the virus are determined primarily by the strength of the combination therapy against the mutant strain and the maximum achievable increase in the uninfected CD4+ T cell concentration. We also predict, if the parameters of the model remain constant during therapy, that less intensive maintenance regimens will be unable to maintain low viral loads for extensive periods of time. However, if the reduction in viral load produced by therapy reduces the state of activation of the immune system, the number of cells susceptible for HIV-1 infection may decrease even though total CD4+ T cells increase. Our model predicts that if this occurs strong inductive therapy that reduces viral load followed by weaker maintenance regimes may succeed.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\nMathematical analysis of antiretroviral therapy aimed at HIV-1 eradication or maintenance of low viral loads, Wein L, D'Amato R, Perelson A, 1998, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 192, 81-98.

Luminal proton secretion has been assigned to an H-K-ATPase, which has been represented by adapting the kinetic model of the gastric enzyme by Brzezinski et al. (P. Brzezinski, B. G. Malmstrom, P. Lorentzon, and B. Wallmark. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 942: 215-219, 1988). In shifting to a 2 H+:1 ATP stoichiometry, the model enzyme can acidify the tubule lumen approximately 3 pH units below that of the cytosol, when luminal K+ is in abundance. Peritubular base exit is a combination of ammonia recycling and HCO3- flux (either via Cl-/HCO3- exchange or via a Cl- channel). Ammonia recycling involves NH4(+) uptake on the Na-K-ATPase followed by diffusive NH3 exit [S. M. Wall. Am. J. Physiol. 270 (Renal Physiol. 39): F432-F439, 1996]; model calculations suggest that this is the principal mode of base exit. By virtue of this mechanism, the model also suggests that realistic elevations in peritubular K+ concentration will compromise IMCD acid secretion. Although ammonia recycling is insensitive to carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition, the base exit linked to HCO3- flux provides a CA-sensitive component to acid secretion. In model simulations, it is observed that increased luminal NaCl entry increases ammonia cycling but decreases peritubular Cl-/HCO3- exchange (due to increased cell Cl-). This parallel system of peritubular base exit stabilizes acid secretion in the face of variable Na+ reabsorption.\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of the inner medullary collecting duct of the rat: acid/base transport, Alan M.

It has been curated, the units are consistent and the model runs in COR and PCEnv to replicate the published results.\n\nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) has been developed, consisting of a-intercalated cells and a paracellular pathway, and which includes Na, K, Cl, HCO3, CO2, H2CO3, phosphate, ammonia, and urea. Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is mediated by both H-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H-ATPase, flux through the H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway. Peritubular HCO3 exit is via a conductive pathway and via the Cl/HCO3 exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees celcius in red blood cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996; Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1 or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant, including delivered HCO3 and HPO4, as well as peritubular NH3. Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total proton secretion by this tubule segment.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct of the rat, A.M.

The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and/or GAPDH activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and/or GAPDH activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Model of Phosphofructokinase and Glycolytic Oscillations in the Pancreatic Beta-cell, Pal O.

This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR, however the model works in milliseconds, and must be run for at least 600000 time units or more (to simulate 10 minutes) and could not be changed to portray minutes instead. Due to the large iterations, and large point density required to run the model, problems were found in PCEnv and COR where the model would crash or not display properly giving an memory exceded error. Current parameterization of the model replicates Figure 9 of the paper. The initial conditions for all variables were provided in the Bertram code (given as V=-66, n=0, c=0.17, ATP=2.4, ADP=0.05) however these figures still required a warmup period for the functions so they were changed by running the model to steady state then cloning to the output to better replicate the figures from the paper. \nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: The electrical activity of insulin-secreting pancreatic islets of Langerhans is characterized by bursts of action potentials. Most often this bursting is periodic, but in some cases it is modulated by an underlying slower rhythm. We suggest that the modulatory rhythm for this complex bursting pattern is due to oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some other slow process. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model of glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting in islets. We show that the combined model can reproduce several complex bursting patterns from mouse islets published in the literature, and we illustrate how these complex oscillations are produced through the use of a fast/slow analysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tComplex bursting in pancreatic islets: a potential glycolytic mechanism, Wierschem, Bertram, 2004, Journal of Theoretical Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t, 228, 513-521.

Recently, spiral intercellular waves of calcium have been observed in slices of hippocampal tissue. We use an existing model to study the properties of spiral intercellular calcium waves. Although intercellular spiral waves are well known in the context of cardiac muscle, due to the small value of the calcium diffusion coefficient intercellular calcium waves have fundamentally different properties. We show that homogenisation techniques give a good estimate for the plane wave speed, but do not describe spiral behaviour well. Using an expression for the effective diffusion coefficient we estimate the intercellular calcium permeability in liver. For the bistable equation, we derive an analytic estimate for the value of the intercellular permeability at which wave propagation fails. In the calcium wave model, we show numerically that the spiral period is first a decreasing, then an increasing, function of the intercellular permeability. We hypothesise that this is because the curvature of the spiral core is unimportant at low permeability, the period being approximately set instead by the speed of a plane wave along a line of coupled cells in one dimension.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIntercellular Spiral Waves of Calcium, Matthew Wilkins and James Sneyd, 1998,Journal of Theoretical Biology, 191, 299-308.

The units are continuous throughout but the model does not recreate the published results. It utilizes DAE solving techniques and advances in these could result in better output.     \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: We describe a phenomenon of hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity (HAGPA) in prefrontal cortex neurons. Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem.   \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nHyperpolarization-Activated Graded Persistent Activity in the Prefrontal Cortex, Milena Winograd, Alain Destexhe, Maria V.

It is defined as an elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed so far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and the transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models are used to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological memory: the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between different pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting protection against reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an inferior pathogen species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen diversity memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under specific circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the presence of pathogen diversity.    \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nEvolution of Immunological Memory and the Regulation of Competition between Pathogens, Dominik Wodarz, 2003, Current Biology, 13, 1648-1652.

We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nInfection dynamics in HIV-specific CD4 T cells: Does a CD4 T cell boost benefit the host or the virus?, Dominik Wodarz and Dean H.

At the same time, they can cause disease when induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That is, CTL expansion occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is in contrast to direct presentation where antigen is seen on the surface of the target cells (e.g. infected cells or tumor cells). Here we introduce a mathematical model, which takes the phenomenon of cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is implicit in the dynamics of the CTL: According to the model, the ability of a CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively high, CTL responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively low, tolerance is the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our results with respect to the idea of self/non-self discrimination and the danger signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer initiation, cancer evolution/progression, and therapeutic vaccination against cancers.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA dynamical perspective of CTL cross-priming and regulation: implications for cancer immunology, Dominik Wodarz and Vincent A.

The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients, specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory. Whether such treatment regimes would lead to long-term immunologic control deserves investigation under carefully controlled conditions.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nSpecific therapy regimes could lead to long-term immunological control of HIV, Dominik Wodarz and Martin A.

Recently, experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as \"CTL memory inflation\". In order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n                              Dynamics of killer T cell inflation in viral infections, Dominik Wodarz, Sophie Sierro and Paul Klenerman, 2007, Journal of the Royal Society, Interface, volume 4, issue 14, 533-543.

Note that the CellML model represents a single cell (N=1).    \n\nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: On the basis of a detailed model of yeast glycolysis, the effect of intercellular dynamics is analysed theoretically. The model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic parameter, the single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various process on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally.

Additional data from patients with a defect of complex I of the res-piratory chain and a patient with a deficiency in the mitochondrial adenine nucleoside translocase were also predicted the by the model by making the appropriate adjustments to the activities of the affected proteins associates with the defects, providing both further validation of the biophysical model of the control of oxidative phosphorylation and insight into the impact of these diseases on the ability of the cell to maintain its energetic state.     \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\nOxidative ATP Synthesis in Skeletal Muscle is Controlled by Substrate Feedback, Fan Wu, Jeroen A.L.

This model is constructed based on detailed kinetics and thermodynamically balanced reaction mechanisms and a strict accounting of rapidly equilibrating biochemical species. Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic parameters, a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function.     \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tComputer Modeling of Mitochondrial Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Metabolite Transport, and Electrophysiology, Fan Wu, Feng Yang, Kalyan C.

It recreates the published results for the simulation, except in the case of FTI_end, FLA_max and ATP, because CellML cannot compute finite integrals or maximums of functions. These values are instead estimated based on graphs, but must be re-estimated for different initial conditions. The parameters for this model are the control values. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: We simulated myocardial Ca2+ (Ca) and cross-bridge (CB) kinetics to get insight into the experimentally observed constancy and variability of cardiac contractile efficiency in generating total mechanical energy under various inotropic and pathological conditions. The simulation consisted of a Ca transient, Ca association and dissociation rate constants of troponin C, and CB on and off rate constants. We evaluated sarcomere isometric twitch contractions at a constant muscle length. We assumed that each CB cycle hydrolyzes one ATP and that the force-length area (FLA) quantifies the total mechanical energy generated by CB cycles in a twitch contraction. FLA is a linear version of pressure-volume area, which quantifies the total mechanical energy of cardiac twitch contraction and correlates linearly with cardiac oxygen consumption (H. Suga, Physiol. Rev. 70: 247-277, 1990). The simulation shows that the contractile efficiency varies with changes in the Ca transient and Ca and CB kinetics except when they simultaneously speed up or slow down proportionally. These results point to possible mechanisms underlying the constancy and variability of cardiac contractile efficiency.    \n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nConstancy and variability of contractile efficiency as a function of calcium and cross-bridge kinetics: simulation, Hiroki Yamaguchi, Miyako Takaki, Hiromi Matsubara, Shingo Yasuhara, and Hiroyuki Suga,  1996, American Journal of Physiology, 270, H1501-1508.

In this model four dynamic currents, the sodium current iNa, the slow inward current, is, the potassium current, iK, and the hyperpolarization-activated current, ih, in addition to a time-dependent leak current, i1 were included. The model simulated the spontaneous action potential the current voltage relationship, and the voltage clamp experiment in normal Tyrode solution of the rabbit S-A node. Furthermore, the changes of activity induced by the potassium current blocker Ba2+, by applying constant current, acetylcholine, and epinephrine were also reconstructed. It was strongly suggested that the pacemaker depolarization in the S-A node cell is mainly due to a gradual increase of iS during diastole, and that the contribution of iK is much less compared to the potassium current iK2 in the Purkinje fiber pacemaker depolarization. The rising phase of the action potential was due to iS and the plateau phase is determined by both the inactivation of iS and activation of iK.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nReconstruction of sino-atrial node pacemaker potential based on the voltage clamp experiments, K.

These models are primarily electrical, biochemical or mechanical in their orientation, and do not permit a full exploration of how the smooth muscle responds to electrical or mechanical forcing. To address this issue, we have developed a new model that consists of two major components: electrochemical and chemomechanical subsystem models of the smooth muscle cell. Included in the electrochemical model are models of the electrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and cytosolic Ca2+ buffering, particularly by calmodulin (CM). With this subsystem model, we can study the mechanics of the production of intracellular Ca2+ transient in response to membrane voltage clamp pulses. The chemomechanical model includes models of: (a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of phosphorylated (cycling) myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as attached (non-cycling) latch-type cross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to the contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the skeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested independently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell model responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic conditions are calculated and compared with measured single cell length-force and force-velocity data obtained from literature. This integrated cell model provides biophysically based explanations of electrical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena in cerebrovascular smooth muscle, and has considerable utility as an adjunct to laboratory research and experimental design.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nThe myogenic response in isolated rat cerebrovascular arteries: smooth muscle cell model, Jin Yang, John W.

It will recreate published results, although it only models a single organ (the liver) as well as the veins and arteries, and is based on a 5 year old boy. The model cannot replicate the population analysis described in the paper, which needs stochastic tools that are unavailable to CellML at present. \n          \nModel Structure\n\nAbstract: Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data are available to use in methadone dosing recommendations in pediatric patients for either opioid abstinence or analgesia. Considering the extreme inter-individual variability of absorption and metabolism of methadone, population-based PK would be useful to provide insight into the relationship between dose, blood concentrations, and clinical effects of methadone. To address this need, an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been constructed to systematically study methadone metabolism and PK. The model will facilitate the design of cost-effective studies that will evaluate methadone PK and PD relationships, and may be useful to guide methadone dosing in children. The PBPK model, which includes whole-body multi-organ distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism, and clearance, is parameterized based on a database of pediatric PK parameters and data collected from clinical experiments. The model is further tailored and verified based on PK data from individual adults, then scaled appropriately to apply to children aged 0-24 months. Based on measured variability in CYP3A enzyme expression levels and plasma orosomucoid (ORM2) concentrations, a Monte-Carlo-based simulation of methadone kinetics in a pediatric population was performed. The simulation predicts extreme variability in plasma concentrations and clearance kinetics for methadone in the pediatric population, based on standard dosing protocols. In addition, it is shown that when doses are designed for individuals based on prior protein expression information, inter-individual variability in methadone kinetics may be greatly reduced.    \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nPopulation-based analysis of methadone distribution and metabolism using an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, Feng Yang, Xianping Tong, D.

The units are consistent and the original source code was used to fix the CellML model such that it now runs to recreate the published results. The original paper contains three different mathematical models and this particular CellML model represents the first model of self-renewing memory CD4+ T cell homeostasis in the absence of HIV infection.\n          \nModel Structure\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The asymptomatic phase of HIV infection is characterised by a slow decline of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells. Why this decline is slow is not understood. One potential explanation is that the low average rate of homeostatic proliferation or immune activation dictates the pace of a \"runaway\" decline of memory CD4(+) T cells, in which activation drives infection, higher viral loads, more recruitment of cells into an activated state, and further infection events. We explore this hypothesis using mathematical models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using simple mathematical models of the dynamics of T cell homeostasis and proliferation, we find that this mechanism fails to explain the time scale of CD4(+) memory T cell loss. Instead it predicts the rapid attainment of a stable set point, so other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the slow decline in CD4(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: A runaway cycle in which elevated CD4(+) T cell activation and proliferation drive HIV production and vice versa cannot explain the pace of depletion during chronic HIV infection. We summarize some alternative mechanisms by which the CD4(+) memory T cell homeostatic set point might slowly diminish. While none are mutually exclusive, the phenomenon of viral rebound, in which interruption of antiretroviral therapy causes a rapid return to pretreatment viral load and T cell counts, supports the model of virus adaptation as a major force driving depletion.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nUnderstanding the slow depletion of memory CD4+ T cells in HIV infection, Andrew Yates, Jaroslav Stark, Nigel Klein, Rustom Antia, and Robin Callard, 2007, PLoS Medicine, volume 4, issue 5, 948-955.

For both hypoxia and ischemia, depriving the tissue of oxygen causes cells to switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration.  This results in reduced ATP synthesis, which in turn decreases the effectiveness of the cell membrane ion pumps, especially the Na-K-ATPase pump.  Additionally, in the case of ischemia, reduced blood flow has the effect of reducing the tissue's supply of metabolic substrates, and it also reduces the efficiency of waste product removal.     \n\n\nIschemia and hypoxia have been experimentally studied in a wide variety of species and different tissue types.  Tissue responses to ischemia include swelling of the intracellular space, shrinkage of the extracellular space, and an increase in the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e).  In neural tissue, this increase in extracellular potassium concentration occurs in two stages; an initial rapid increase from about 5 mM to 55 mM, followed by a slower increase up to 80 mM.  In cardiac myocytes, there are generally three phases observed: a rapid increase, a relative plateau, and a second, slower increase.  These increases in extracellular potassium concentration may have important pathological consequences.  For example, in cardiac ischemia, the increased [K+]e may cause arrhythmias.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn 2003, Chung-Seon Yi, Aaron L. Fogelson, James P. Keener, and Charles S. Peskin studied the possible mechanisms underlying extracellular potassium accumulation during ischemia.  They developed a simple Hodgkin-Huxley type ionic model, which unlike other previously published models of cardiac myocytes, includes extracellular volume, capillary flow and the influence of nearby healthy tissue as variables (see figure 1 and figure 2 below).  The model describes events in a tissue consisting of a collection of homogeneous cells subject to ischemia or hypoxia, a homogeneous extracellular space surrounding three cells, a capillary compartment representing the vasculature for this piece of tissue, and another compartment corresponding to the healthy tissue surrounding the ischemic or hypoxic tissue.  The first three compartments combine to form the damaged tissue.  \n\n\nModel simulations produce a response to ischemia similar to that seen in neural tissue, and the mechanisms underlying this process in the model is elucidated.  However, Yi et al. found that the same underlying mechanism is not present in the cardiac ion model, and they suggest that this difference may explain the qualitative difference in response observed in cardiac tissue.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA Mathematical Study of Volume Shifts and Ionic Concentration Changes during Ischemia and Hypoxia, Chung-Seon Yi, Aaron L.

        "description": "Model Status\n\n        This CellML version of the model runs in both COR and PCEnv.  Although the model produces pacemaker potentials, there are discrepancies between the original and the CellML model - including a different behaviour at the resting membrane potential and a different frequency of generation of slow waves.  The units have been checked and are consistent.  We'd like to acknowledge Nandita Carvalho for providing us with access to her Matlab code, which played a critical role in the process of successfully translating the model into CellML.  Also Alberto Corrias for his feedback on the CellML model\n          \nModel Structure\n\nPhasic gastrointestinal (GI) muscle is able to autonomously generate rhythmic contractions independent of the enteric nervous system.  The electrical activity that generates these rhythmic contractions are called slow waves, or pacemaker potentials (PP), and they are produced by a specialised group of pacemaker cells called Insterstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC).  Pacemaker potentials pass via gap junctions from the ICC to smooth muscle cells (SMC), activating L-type Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx and the contraction of the SMC.\n\n\nIn the study described here, Jae Boum Youm et al. have developed a mathematical model which quantitatively describes the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics from a single ICC pacemaker unit.  The model includes seven major currents that flow across the ICC membrane to transport three ions, Na+, Ca2+ and K+ (see the figure below).  These currents include: the inward rectifier current (Ik1), L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL), voltage-dependent and dihydropyridine-resistant current (IVDDR), autonomous inward current. (IAI), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current, (INaCa), Na+/K+ pump current (INaK), and the plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump current (IPMCA). \n\n\nIt should be noted that the model described here in CellML is not identical to the published model.  Instead, it represents the working model written in Matlab by Nandita Carvalho, who carried out an extensive literature review and had personal correspondence with the author of the original model Jae Boum Youm.  On comparison, the final model was able to replicate experimental results and hence it was used to make predictions of slow wave characteristics of the small intestine.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model of pacemaker activity recorded from mouse small intestine, Jae Boum Youm, Nari Kim, Jin Han, Euiyong Kim, Hyun Joo, Chae Hun Leem, Gazunori Goto, Akinori Noma, and Yung E.

It has been linked to beneficial effects such as mammary tumor growth suppression and adverse endocrine-related effects such as reduced birth weight in rats and humans. In its conjugated form, genistein is excreted in the bile, which is a significant factor in its pharmacokinetics. Experimental data suggest that genistein induces a concentration-dependent suppression of biliary excretion. In this article, we describe a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that focuses on biliary excretion with the goal of accurately simulating the observed suppression. The mathematical model is a system of nonlinear differential equations with state-dependent delay to describe biliary excretion. The model was analyzed to examine local existence and uniqueness of a solution to the equations. Furthermore, unknown parameters were estimated, and the mathematical model was compared against published experimental data.\n\n\nA delayed nonlinear PBPK model for genistein dosimetry in rats, Michael G.

More importantly, it appears it has been coded to conform with procedural matlab code, and even if the above errors were fixed, other problems would likely persist. \n          \nModel Structure\nABSTRACT: Two distinct delayed rectifier K+ currents, IKr and IKs, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier K+ current in the model was replaced by IKr and IKs. Our results show that IKs is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either IKr or IKs can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of IKr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, > 80% block of IKs results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high IKs-to-IKr density ratio (approximately 8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, IKr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of IKs to IKr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both IKr and IKs is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (ICa) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of IKr and IKs; it increases when the IKr-to-IKs density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i. This in turn causes different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of ICa and different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent conductance of IKs at very long DIs (> 5 s) for different BCLs. This BCL dependence of ICa and IKs that is secondary to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a \"memory property\" of cardiac cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\nTwo Components of the Delayed Rectifier K+ Current in Ventricular Myocytes of the Guinea Pig Type, Jinglin Zeng, Kenneth R.

Simulated action potentials are consistent with those recorded experimentally: the model-generated peripheral action potential has a more negative takeoff potential, faster upstroke, more positive peak value, prominent phase 1 repolarization, greater amplitude, shorter duration, and more negative maximum diastolic potential than the model-generated central action potential. In addition, the model peripheral cell shows faster pacemaking. The models behave qualitatively the same as tissue from the periphery and center of the SA node in response to block of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) current, L- and T-type Ca(2+) currents, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current, rapid and slow delayed rectifying K(+) currents, and hyperpolarization-activated current. A one-dimensional model of a string of SA node tissue, incorporating regional heterogeneity, coupled to a string of atrial tissue has been constructed to simulate the behavior of the intact SA node. In the one-dimensional model, the spontaneous action potential initiated in the center propagates to the periphery at approximately 0.06 m/s and then into the atrial muscle at 0.62 m/s.\nThe original paper is cited below.\n\nMathematical models of action potentials in the periphery and center of the rabbit sinoatrial node, H.
