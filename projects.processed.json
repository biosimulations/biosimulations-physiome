Therefore, a biophysically based single cell model of human jejunal smooth muscle electrophysiology was developed.

We analysed the effect these cellular mechanisms have on whole heart function by making a computational model of mouse heart cells, and embedding this cellular model into a representation of the heart. Unlike previous murine models, this model represents the heart at both body temperature and the high heart rates seen in these animals, allowing us to directly compare results from our computational model with experimental measurements. Results show that effects from the rate of stretch are especially important for explaining the large differences observed between force generated by isolated cells and pressure measured experimentally. The model also provides an important framework for future research focused on interpreting results from genetic manipulation experiments in mice.\n \n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| **Cell model overview:**\nCalcium binds to troponin C (TRPN) in a cooperative way.

We sought to develop an in silico AP (isAP) model that provides an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte AP duration (APD) using concentration-effect curve data from a panel of five ICs (hNav1.5, hCav1.2, hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2, hKv7.1/hminK, hKv11.1). A test set of 53 compounds was selected to cover a range of selective and mixed IC modulators that were tested for their effects on optically measured APD. A threshold of >10% change in APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) was used to signify an effect at the top test concentration. To capture the variations observed in left ventricular midmyocardial myocyte APD data from 19 different dogs, the isAP model was calibrated to produce an ensemble of 19 model variants that could capture the shape and form of the APs and also quantitatively replicate dofetilide- and diltiazem-induced APD90 changes. Provided with IC panel data only, the isAP model was then used, blinded, to predict APD90 changes greater than 10%. At a simulated concentration of 30 \u00b5M and based on a criterion that six of the variants had to agree, isAP prediction was scored as showing greater than 80% predictivity of compound activity. Thus, early in drug discovery, the isAP model allows integrating separate IC data and is amenable to the throughput required for use as a virtual screen.\n \n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| \n Schematic diagram of the Davies et al. 2012 (Hund and Rudy 2004) Canine Ventricular Cell Model.\n  |\n\n\n\n The original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n An in silico canine cardiac midmyocardial action potential duration model as a tool for early drug safety assessment, M.

The latter phenomenon often occurs as repetitive Ca2+ spikes. In this study, the effect of the two Ins-1,4,5-P3 metabolizing enzymes (Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase) on the temporal pattern of Ca2+ oscillations has been investigated. On the basis of the well-documented Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase stimulation by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex and of the experimentally-determined kinetic characteristics of these enzymes, we predict that 5-phosphatase primarily controls the levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and, thereby, the occurrence and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Consequently, the model reproduces the experimental observation performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that 5-phosphatase overexpression has a much more pronounced effect on the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations than 3-kinase overexpression. We also investigated, in more detail, under which conditions a similar effect could be observed in other cell types expressing various Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase activities.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n'Simulations of the effects of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase activities on Ca2+ oscillations.', G Dupont, C Erneux, 1997 *Cell Calcium*, 22(5), 321-331.

The results match output from a reference (IgorPro) implementation of the model provided by David Friel.\n\n\nModel Structure\n---------------\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: [Ca2+]i oscillations have been described in a variety of cells. This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Inactivation of the intracellular Ca2+ permeability, cooperative nonlinear Ca2+ uptake and extrusion mechanisms, and functional links between plasma membrane Ca2+ transport and the internal store are not required.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons: an experimental test of a theoretical model, David D.

The a model is based on equations 1-3 and works to reproduce published results. The b model is based on equations 1 and 4-8 and oscillates but does not reproduce results.\n\n\nModel Structure\n---------------\n\n\n\nCytosolic calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in cellular signalling. Various cell types, including hepatocytes, display Ca2+ oscillations when stimulated by an extracellular signal. However, the biological relevance of this temporal organization remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the effect of Ca2+ oscillations on a particular example of cell regulation: the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle controlling the activation of glycogen phosphorylase in hepatocytes. By modelling periodic sinusoidal variations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, we show that Ca2+ oscillations reduce the threshold for the activation of the enzyme. Furthermore, as the activation of a given enzyme depends on the kinetics of its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, speciality can be encoded by the oscillation frequency. Finally, using a model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, we show that realistic Ca2+ oscillations can potentiate the response to a hormonal stimulation. These results indicate that Ca2+ oscillations in hepatocytes could contribute to increase the efficiency and speciality of cellular signalling, as shown experimentally for gene expression in lymphocytes (Dolmetsch et al., 1998).\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nActivation of the Liver Glycogen Phosphorylase by Ca2+ Oscillations: \na Theoretical Study', DAVID GALL, ERIKA BAUS, AND GENEVIEEVE DUPONT, 2000 *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 207, 445-454.

The R-point occurs in mid-to-late G1 phase and marks the transition between mitogendependent to mitogen-independent progression of the cell cycle. For purposes of computer simulations, the R-point is defined as the first point in time after mitosis where cutting off mitogen stimulation does not prevent the cell reaching the threshold activity of cyclin-E/cdk2 required for entry into S phase. The key components of the network that generate a dynamic switching behaviour associated with the R-point include a positive feedback loop between cyclin-E/cdk2 and Cdc25A, along with the mutually negative interaction between the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and cyclin-E/cdk2. Simulations of the passage through the R-point were carried out and the factors affecting the position of the R-point in G1 are determined. The detailed model also shows various points in the network where the activation of cyclin-E/cdk2 can be initiated with or without the involvement of the retinoblastoma protein.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n[The kinetic origins of the restriction point in the mammalian cell cycle](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119096039/abstract), B.

In excitable cells, depolarisation-induced Ca2+ entry increases [Ca2+]i, leading to secondary changes in [Ca2+] within organelles such as mitochondria and ER that regulate specific Ca2+-sensitive targets within these organelles. Although mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ in response to depolarisation-evoked [Ca2+]i elevations (see [The Colegrove *et al* Model Of Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake And Release, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/colegrove_albrecht_friel_2000_version01)), the ER is also an important component in Ca2+ signalling in virtually all non-muscle cells, and it has been described as either a Ca2+ source or sink. Different modes of net ER Ca2+ transport are expected to have very different effects on cytoplasmic and intraluminal Ca2+ signals and on the processes they regulate (see [The Albrecht *et al* Model Of Multiple Modes of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ Release in Sympathetic Neurons, 2001](http://www.cellml.org/models/albrecht_colegrove_hongpaisan_pivovarova_andrews_friel_2001_version01)). \n\n\n\n\nIn a follow up study to their 2001 paper, Meredith A. Albrecht, Stephen L. Colegrove and David D. Friel have examined how differential regulation of ER Ca2+ uptake and release rates accounts for multiple modes of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Three different macroscopic Ca2+ fluxes were modelled: JSERCA, the rate of Ca2+ uptake via SR Ca-ATPases; JICa, the total cytoplasmic Ca2+ flux when SR Ca-ATPases are inhibited; and Jpm, the rate of Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane. One additional flux Jrelease was calculated from the difference between JICa and Jpm (see \n the figure\n below).

Different modes of net ER Ca2+ transport are expected to have very different effects on cytoplasmic and intraluminal Ca2+ signals and on the processes they regulate. \n\n\n\n\nIn their 2001 model, Meredith A. Albrecht, Stephen L. Colegrove, Jarin Hongpaisan, Natalia B. Pivovarova, S. Brian Andrews and David D. Friel have examined the relationship between changes in [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]ER during weak depolarisation in sympathetic neurons. The total Ca2+ flux during the recovery phase following membrane depolarisation was divided into four components (see \n the figure\n below). One representing net Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane (Jextru), one representing Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (JICa), one representing ER Ca2+ uptake via a Ca2+ ATPase (JSERCA) and one representing passive ER Ca2+ release. This mathematical model has been translated into a CellML description which can be downloaded in various formats as described in .\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Multiple Modes of Calcium-induced Calcium Release in Sympathetic Neurons I: Attenuation of Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Accumulation at Low [Ca2+]i during Weak Depolarisation](http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/abstract/118/1/83), Meredith A.

The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can be used to design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nAn integrated model of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on lipidomics flux analysis, Gupta S, Maurya MR, Stephens DL, Dennis EA, Subramaniam S, 2009, *Biophysical Journal*, volume 96, 4542-4551.

Reliable computational models of the sinoatrial node (SAN) action potential (AP) may help gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Recently, novel models incorporating detailed Ca2+-handling dynamics have been proposed, but they fail to reproduce a number of experimental data, and more specifically effects of \u0091funny' (*I*f) current modifications. We therefore developed a SAN AP model, based on available experimental data, in an attempt to reproduce physiological and pharmacological heart rate modulation. Cell compartmentalization and intracellular Ca2+-handling mechanisms were formulated as in the Maltsev\u0096Lakatta model, focusing on Ca2+-cycling processes. Membrane current equations were revised on the basis of published experimental data. Modifications of the formulation of currents/pumps/exchangers to simulate *I*f blockers, autonomic modulators and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms (ivabradine, caesium, acetylcholine, isoprenaline, BAPTA) were derived from experimental data. The model generates AP waveforms typical of rabbit SAN cells, whose parameters fall within the experimental ranges: 352 ms cycle length, 80 mV AP amplitude, -58 mV maximum diastolic potential (MDP), 108 ms APD50, and 7.1 V s-1 maximum upstroke velocity. Rate modulation by *I*f-blocking drugs agrees with experimental findings: 20% and 22% caesium-induced (5 mM) and ivabradine-induced (3 \u00b5M) rate reductions, respectively, due to changes in diastolic depolarization (DD) slope, with no changes in either MDP or take-off potential (TOP). The model consistently reproduces the effects of autonomic modulation: 20% rate decrease with 10 nMacetylcholine and 28% increase with 1 \u00b5M isoprenaline, again entirely due to increase in the DD slope, with no changes in either MDP or TOP. Model testing of BAPTA effects showed slowing of rate, -26%, without cessation of beating. Our up-to-date model describes satisfactorily experimental data concerning autonomic stimulation, funny-channel blockade and inhibition of the Ca2+-related system by BAPTA, making it a useful tool for further investigation. Simulation results suggest that a detailed description of the intracellular Ca2+fluxes is fully compatible with the observation that *I*f is a major component of pacemaking and rate modulation.\n\n\n",

        "description": "\n\nTesting out the nest proposal variants with CellML models\n=========================================================\n\n\n\n I wanted to have a play with some concrete examples of the SED-ML nested proposal with CellML models in order to be clear in my own mind about how this stuff works. So I wrote up a couple of dummy test cases: [sin\\_approximations\\_sedml-nested-Frank.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/sin_approximations_sedml-nested-Frank.xml) uses Frank's nested simulation variant of the proposal to trivial 'parameter scan' using a very simple test model, and [sin\\_approximations\\_sedml-nested-Nicolas.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/sin_approximations_sedml-nested-Nicolas.xml) does the same but using Nicolas' repeated task varianbt of the proposal. In both of these (and the following), the data generators are largely ignored and irrelevant for now.\n \n\n\n\n Such trivial examples don't help a lot, so I thought I'd try something a bit more like what I'd actually want to be able to do. We have a CellML encoding of a really fancy and modern human cardiac electrophysiology model ([The ORd human ventricular action potential model](http://models.cellml.org/e/71)). This model has three variants representing the three cell types generally considered in modelling the electrophysiology of cardiac muscle - epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial. The specific variant for a simulation is selected with the `celltype` parameter in the model (0, 1, or 2). The default model includes a single electrical stimulus applied at the time specified by the `stimStart` parameter value.\n \n\n\n\n So, to test out a simple repeated task I set up [nestedTask-cellType-ORd.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/nestedTask-cellType-ORd.xml) which uses a `vectorRange` to specify the values to loop over representing the various cell types. Because there are no tools to run this yet, I also set up various models needed to do this using SED-ML L1V1 which gives the following output using the SED-ML web tools.\n \n\n\n![](ORd/nestedTask-cellType-ORd--sedml.xml.png)\n\n The various CellML models are available in this workspace, and the SED-ML document is: [ORd/nestedTask-cellType-ORd--sedml.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/ORd/nestedTask-cellType-ORd--sedml.xml).\n \n\n\n\n Then I thought to test out nested repeated tasks, a common experiment to perform is to investigate the effect of stimulus protocol on each of the cell types. [nestedTask-cellType-stimulusTime-ORd.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/nestedTask-cellType-stimulusTime-ORd.xml) uses the same repeated task to iterate over the various cell types, but now has a nested sub task which loops over multiple values for the time at which the electrical stimulus is applied. Once again, I set up a subset of the full set of models required to duplicate this experiment in SED-ML L1V1 which gives the following output from the SED-ML Web Tools.\n \n\n\n![](ORd/nestedTask-cellType-stimulusTime-ORd--sedml.xml.png)\n\n The various CellML models are available in this workspace, and the SED-ML document is: [ORd/nestedTask-cellType-stimulusTime-ORd--sedml.xml](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/c2/ORd/nestedTask-cellType-stimulusTime-ORd--sedml.xml).\n \n\n\n\n",

The model couples microtubular protein (MTP) dynamics to the glycolytic pathway and its branches: the Krebs cycle, ethanolic fermentation, and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Results show that the flux through glycolysis coherently and coordinately increases or decreases with increased or decreased levels of polymerized MTP, respectively. The rates of individual enzymatic steps and metabolite concentrations change with the polymeric status of MTP throughout the metabolic network. Negative control is exerted by the PP pathway on the glycolytic flux, and the extent of inhibition depends inversely on the polymerization state of MTP, i.e. a high degree of polymerization relieves the negative control. The stability of the model's steady state dynamics for a wide range of variation of metabolic parameters increased with the degree of polymerized MTP. The findings indicate that the organization of the cytoskeleton bestows coherence and robustness to the coordination of cellular metabolism.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCoherent and robust modulation of a metabolic network by cytoskeletal organization and dynamics, Miguel A.

In this study, a biophysically detailed three-dimensional computer model of the right atrial tissue was constructed to study the role of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy in arrhythmogenesis. The model of Lindblad et al. for a rabbit atrial cell was modified to incorporate experimental data on regional differences in several ionic currents (primarily, I(Na), I(CaL), I(K1), I(to), and I(sus)) between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscle cells. The modified model was validated by its ability to reproduce the AP properties measured experimentally. The anatomical model of the rabbit RA (including tissue geometry and fiber orientation) was based on a recent histological reconstruction. Simulations with the resultant electrophysiologically and anatomically detailed three-dimensional model show that complex organization of the RA tissue causes breakdown of regular AP conduction patterns at high pacing rates (>11.75 Hz): as the AP in the crista terminalis cells is longer, and electrotonic coupling transverse to fibers of the crista terminalis is weak, high-frequency pacing at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles results in a unidirectional conduction block toward the crista terminalis and generation of reentry. Contributions of the tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy to reentry initiation mechanisms are quantified by measuring action potential duration (APD) gradients at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles: the APD gradients are high in areas where both heterogeneity and anisotropy are high, such that intrinsic APD differences are not diminished by electrotonic interactions. Thus, our detailed computer model reconstructs complex electrical activity in the RA, and provides new insights into the mechanisms of transition from focal atrial tachycardia into reentry.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of transition from normal to reentrant electrical activity in a model of rabbit atrial tissue: interaction of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy, Oleg V.

We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-a-vis apoptosome formation.\n \n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\n Bistability in Apoptosis: Roles of Bax, Bcl-2 and Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pores.

We propose a new mathematical model for simulating the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis. The new model integrates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways with NO-related reactions, to gain insights into the regulatory effect of the reactive NO species N(2)O(3), non-heme iron nitrosyl species (FeL(n)NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). The biochemical pathways of apoptosis coupled with NO-related reactions are described by ordinary differential equations using mass-action kinetics. In the absence of NO, the model predicts either cell survival or apoptosis (a bistable behavior) with shifts in the onset time of apoptotic response depending on the strength of extracellular stimuli. Computations demonstrate that the relative concentrations of anti- and pro-apoptotic reactive NO species, and their interplay with glutathione, determine the net anti- or pro-apoptotic effects at long time points. Interestingly, transient effects on apoptosis are also observed in these simulations, the duration of which may reach up to hours, despite the eventual convergence to an anti-apoptotic state. Our computations point to the importance of precise timing of NO production and external stimulation in determining the eventual pro- or anti-apoptotic role of NO.\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\n Computational Insights on the Competing Effects of Nitric Oxide in Regulating Apoptosis.

At present it is impossible to remove the glycosome without changing much of the rest of the cell. It would seem impossible, therefore, to assess the metabolic consequences of this compartmentation. Therefore, we here develop a computer experimentation approach, which we call computational cell biology. A validated molecular kinetic computer replica was built of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Removing the glycosome membrane in that replica had little effect on the steady-state flux, which argues against the prevalent speculation that glycosomes serve to increase flux by concentrating the enzymes. Removal of the membrane did cause (i) the sugar phosphates to rise to unphysiologically high levels, which must have pathological effects, and (ii) a failure to recover from glucose deprivation. We explain these effects on the basis of the biochemical organization of the glycosome. We conclude (i) that the glycosome protects trypanosomes from the negative side effects of the \"turbo\" structure of glycolysis and (ii) that computer experimentation based on solid molecular data is a powerful tool to address questions that are not, or not yet, accessible to experimentation. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\nCompartmentation protects trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis, Barbara M.

Most glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei have been purified and characterized kinetically. In this paper a mathematical model of glycolysis in the bloodstream form of this organism is developed on the basis of all available kinetic data. The fluxes and the cytosolic metabolite concentrations as predicted by the model were in accordance with available data as measured in non-growing trypanosomes, both under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions. The model also reproduced the inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis by glycerol, although the amount of glycerol needed to inhibit glycolysis completely was lower than experimentally determined. At low extracellular glucose concentrations the intracellular glucose concentration remained very low, and only at 5 mM of extracellular glucose, free glucose started to accumulate intracellularly, in close agreement with experimental observations. This biphasic relation could be related to the large difference between the affinities of the glucose transporter and hexokinase for intracellular glucose. The calculated intraglycosomal metabolite concentrations demonstrated that enzymes that have been shown to be near-equilibrium in the cytosol must work far from equilibrium in the glycosome in order to maintain the high glycolytic flux in the latter.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nGlycolysis in Bloodstream Form *Trypanosoma brucei* Can Be Understood in Terms of the Kinetics of the Glycolytic Enzyme, Barbara M.

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle\ncontrol. \n\n\n\n\nBudding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have\nbeen proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G1 to S transition. In any given\ngrowth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, PS, to enter S phase. The\nmolecular basis of this control is still under discussion.\n\n\n\n\nThe authors report a mathematical model of the G1 to S network\nthat newly takes into account nucleo/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in\nfacilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-\ncontaining complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the\ntemporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by\nsimulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data.

This could possibly be due to a missing variable k55 in the equation for cdk1\\_c. The units have been checked and are consistent.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: The eukaryotic cell cycle is the repeated sequence of events that enable the division of a cell into two daughter cells. It\nis divided into four phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Passage through the cell cycle is strictly regulated by a molecular\ninteraction network, which involves the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins that bind and activate cyclindependent\nkinases that are present in nonlimiting amounts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle\ncontrol. \n\n\n\n\nBudding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have\nbeen proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G1 to S transition. In any given\ngrowth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, PS, to enter S phase. The\nmolecular basis of this control is still under discussion.\n\n\n\n\nThe authors report a mathematical model of the G1 to S network\nthat newly takes into account nucleo/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in\nfacilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-\ncontaining complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the\ntemporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by\nsimulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data. To\nestimate PS, the authors developed a hybrid model including a probabilistic component for firing of DNA replication\norigins. Sensitivity analysis of PS provides a novel relevant conclusion: PS is an emergent property of the G1 to S\nnetwork that strongly depends on growth rate. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Cell Size at S Phase Initiation: An Emergent Property of the G1/S Network](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030064), Matteo Barberis, Edda Klipp, Marco Vanoni, Lilia Alberghina, 2007, [*PLOS Computational Biology*](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/home.action;jsessionid=645EF1CFEC82DFB57D328F551865F7A6).

The model calculates the local changes in the concentrations of free Ca(2+) and of Ca(2+) bound to the major intrinsic myoplasmic Ca(2+) buffers (troponin, ATP, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca(2+) pump) and to the Ca(2+) indicator (fluo-3). A distinctive feature of the model is the inclusion of a binding reaction between fluo-3 and myoplasmic proteins, a process that strongly affects fluo-3's Ca(2+)-reaction kinetics, its apparent diffusion constant, and hence the morphology of sparks. DeltaF/F (the change in fluo-3's fluorescence divided by its resting fluorescence) was estimated from the calculated changes in fluo-3 convolved with the microscope point-spread function. To facilitate comparisons with measured sparks, noise and other sources of variability were included in a random repetitive fashion to generate a large number of simulated sparks that could be analyzed in the same way as the measured sparks. In the initial simulations, the binding of Ca(2+) to the two regulatory sites on troponin was assumed to follow identical and independent binding reactions. These simulations failed to accurately predict the falling phase of the measured sparks. A second set of simulations, which incorporated the idea of positive cooperativity in the binding of Ca(2+) to troponin, produced reasonable agreement with the measurements. Under the assumption that the single channel Ca(2+) current of a ryanodine receptor (RYR) is 0.5-2 pA, the results suggest that 1-5 active RYRs generate an average Ca(2+) spark in a frog intact muscle fiber.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nComparison of simulated and measured calcium sparks in intact skeletal muscle fibers of the frog, S.M.

The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F1F0 ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate\\u2013hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K+/H+ antiporter and passive H+ and K+ permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nA Biophysical Model of the Mitochondrial Respiratory System and Oxidative Phosphorylation, Daniel A.

The first model of cardiac tissue was developed by Noble in 1962 (see Noble Purkinje Fibre Model, 1962), and contained only four variables. During the following years, improvements in both experimental and computational methods lead to the development of successively more accurate models, for example the Luo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994, and the Noble Ventricular Cell Model, 1998. Recently, comprehensive models have been published which are cell type specific, for example: Nygren *et al.*, 1998; and Courtemanche *et al.*, 1998 have developed models of atrial cells, while others have produced models of the sinoatrial node: Demir *et al.*, 1999; Zhang *et al.*, 2000; and Boyett *et al.*, 2001, or ventricular myocytes: Puglisi-Bers, 2001 and Pandit *et al.*, 2001. \n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Priebe and Beuckelmann published a model of a single human ventricular cell. This was based mainly on the Luo-Rudy II model for a guinea-pig ventricular myocyte, however, five currents (*IKr*, *IKs*, *ICa*, *Ito* and *IK1*) were based on experimental data obtained from human myocytes. The remaining currents from the original LR model were scaled to fit human cell data. Priebe and Beuckelmann used their model to compare the electrophysiological properties of healthy and failing ventricular myocytes. The model was accurate, but its complexity and large number of variables make it computationally inefficient. In addition, as a , made up of ordinary differential equations describing the time dependence of membrane potential, gating variables and ion concentrations, the PB model was unstable. \n\n\n\n\nOften it is not necessary to model the ionic currents of a cell with the accuracy and complexity inherent in the biophysically based models. With a view to investigating phenomena on a larger spatial and temporal scale, several ionic current models have been developed that do not seek to model subcellular processes but only to provide an action potential at a minimal computational cost. Such models include The FitzHugh-Nagumo Model, 1961. However, this approach does not reproduce the shape of action potential, which is important in electrocardiography studies. Neither does it allow the analysis of the effects of individual ionic currents on cardiac activation.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Bernus *et al.* published a mathematical model of human ventricular cells, which was somewhere in between the complex PB and the simple FN models. Their new model was simpler, 4.9 times faster, and more stable than the original PB model on which it was based, yet it was sufficiently complex to retain the shape of the action potential at various frequencies, and also the restitution properties of the human ventricular tissue. This was achieved by reducing the original PB model to a six-variable model (see \n the figure\n below). Major ionic currents were retained, but some single cell properties that do not have a large influence on the properties of the tissue were discarded. Model simulations were able to reproduce the properties of epicardial, endocardial and M cells by modifying selected ionic currents (this raw CellML model is specific to the epicardial cells). In addition, at the tissue level, Bernus *et al.* were able to simulate spiral wave behaviour in a 2-D sheet of human ventricular tissue. Simulation results were supported by their agreement with experimental data.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA computationally efficient electrophysiological model of human ventricular cells, O.

The model runs in both OpenCell and COR, but the membrane only depolarises to -5 mV as opposed to ~40 mV. The units have been checked and there are no inconsistencies (just equivalences).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nABSTRACT: Computational modeling is used to investigate the functional impact of G protein-mediated presynaptic autoinhibition on synaptic filtering properties. It is demonstrated that this form of autoinhibition, which is relieved by depolarization, acts as a high-pass filter. This contrasts with vesicle depletion, which acts as a low-pass filter. Model parameters are adjusted to reproduce kinetic slowing data from different Gbetagamma dimeric isoforms, which produce different degrees of slowing. With these sets of parameter values, we demonstrate that the range of frequencies filtered out by the autoinhibition varies greatly depending on the Gbetagamma isoform activated by the autoreceptors. It is shown that G protein autoinhibition can enhance the spatial contrast between a spatially distributed high-frequency signal and surrounding low-frequency noise, providing an alternate mechanism to lateral inhibition. It is also shown that autoinhibition can increase the fidelity of coincidence detection by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the postsynaptic cell. The filter cut, the input frequency below which signals are filtered, depends on several biophysical parameters in addition to those related to Gbetagamma binding and unbinding. By varying one such parameter, the rate at which transmitter unbinds from autoreceptors, we show that the filter cut can be adjusted up or down for several of the Gbetagamma isoforms. This allows for great synapse-to-synapse variability in the distinction between signal and noise.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRole for G Protein G-Beta-Gamma Isoform Specificity in Synaptic Signal Processing: A Computational Study, Richard Bertram, Michelle I.

Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nThe phantom burster model for pancreatic beta-cells, Richard Bertram, Joseph Previte, Arthur Sherman, Tracie A.

It is currently unsuitably constrained and can not be solved.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nPancreatic beta-cells are located in clusters within the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans. Beta-cells secrete the hormone insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels, and in doing so, they play an essential role in glucose homeostasis. When beta-cells fail to function properly, this can lead to pathologies such as type II diabetes.\n\n\n\n\nInsulin secretion is oscillatory, and it is in-phase with oscillations in the free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and theses Ca2+ oscillations reflect a bursting pattern in the beta-cell electrical activity. Electrical bursting consists of periodic active phases of cell firing (excitation) followed by silent phases of hyperpolarisation (rest). These oscillations can be divided into three categories:\n\n\n\n* *Fast bursting*, which has a period between 2 and 5 seconds and which often occurs in single cells and in islets where acetylcholine is present;\n* *Medium bursting*, which has a period of 10 to 60 seconds and which occurs in islets where there is a stimulatory glucose concentration; and\n* *Slow bursting*, which has a period of 2 to 4 minutes and which occurs in single cells and in islets.\n\n\n\nThe first mathematical models of beta-cells were developed to describe medium bursting, and the first models to address the variability in beta-cell oscillations were developed by Chay in 1995 and 1997 (see [Extracellular and Intracellular Calcium Effects on Pancreatic Beta Cells, Chay, 1997](http://www.cellml.org/models/chay_1997_version04) for more details). In these models the main mechanism for oscillations was variation in the Ca2+ concentration in the ER, which directly or indirectly modulates one or more Ca2+-dependent channels. In the Bertram and Sherman model described here the authors analyse in detail how the ER exerts its affects using a phantom bursting model (see \n the figure\n below). \n\n\n\n\nThe phantom bursting model is a general paradigm for temporal plasticity in bursting in beta-cells in which bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow variables with disparate time constants (see [The Phantom Burster Model for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/bertram_previte_sherman_kinard_satin_2000_version02) for more details). There are three potential slow variables which could drive the phantom bursting *in vivo*:\n\n\n\n* cytosolic Ca2+ concentration;\n* ER Ca2+ concentration;\n* and the ADP to ATP ratio.\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[A Calcium-based Phantom Bursting Model for Pancreatic Islets](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WC7-4BS4GC2-1&_user=140507&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2004&_alid=197872630&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6731&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=e1fdd19a27b1c7938c1d568e59a560e0), Richard Bertram and Arthur Sherman, 2004, [*Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*](http://www.molbiolcell.org/), 66, 1313-1344.

Often, components of different pathways interact, resulting in signaling networks. Biochemical signaling networks were constructed with experimentally obtained constants and analyzed by computational methods to understand their role in complex biological processes. These networks exhibit emergent properties such as integration of signals across multiple time scales, generation of distinct outputs depending on input strength and duration, and self-sustaining feedback loops. Feedback can result in bistable behavior with discrete steady-state activities, well-defined input thresholds for transition between states and prolonged signal output, and signal modulation in response to transient stimuli. These properties of signaling networks raise the possibility that information for \"learned behavior\" of biological systems may be stored within intracellular biochemical reactions that comprise signaling pathways.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEmergent properties of networks of biological signaling pathways.

Modern simulation tools make the analysis of key components and their interactions very effective. This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene-protein network governing the G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. RESULTS: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator-inhibitor module can lead to bistability. Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability. We relate these bifurcations to the cell cycle checkpoint and the G1/S phase transition point. Thus, core modules can explain major features of the complex G1/S network and have a robust decision taking function.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n'Bifurcation analysis of the regulatory modules of \nthe mammalian G1/S transition', Maciej Swat, Alexander Kel,Hanspeter Herzel 2004 *Bioinformatics*, 10, 1506-1511.

Wherever possible, we used Markov models to represent the molecular structure and function of ion channels. The model includes detailed intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, with simulations of localized events such as sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release into a small intracellular volume bounded by the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transporter-mediated Ca2+ fluxes from the bulk cytosol are closely matched to the experimentally reported values and predict stimulation rate-dependent changes in Ca2+ transients. Our model reproduces the properties of cardiac myocytes from two different regions of the heart: the apex and the septum. The septum has a relatively prolonged AP, which reflects a relatively small contribution from the rapid transient outward K+ current in the septum. The attribution of putative molecular bases for several of the component currents enables our mouse model to be used to simulate the behavior of genetically modified transgenic mice.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Computer model of action potential of mouse ventricular myocytes, Vladimir E.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential risks and benefits of interrupted therapy using standard population dynamical models of HIV replication kinetics. METHODS: Standard population dynamical models were used to study the effect of structured therapy interruptions on the immune effector cells, the latent cell compartment and the emergence of drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The models suggest that structured therapy interruption only leads to transient or sustained virus control if the immune effector cells increase during therapy. This increase must more than counterbalance the increase in susceptible target cells induced by therapy. The risk of inducing drug resistance by therapy interruptions or the risk of repopulating the pool of latent cells during drug-free periods may be small if the virus population remains at levels considerably below baseline. However, if the virus load increases during drug-free periods to levels similar to or higher than baseline before therapy, both these risks increase dramatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRisks and benefits of structured antiretroviral drug therapy interruptions in HIV-1 infection, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Michal Rembiszewski, Gabriel M.

Validation was done in both CellML and Matlab, Matlab was used to simulate variations in GAP and R concentrations and to reproduce figures 3A and B. \n \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is regulated by signaling modules composed of heterotrimeric G proteins, active G protein-coupled receptors (Rs), which activate G proteins, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which deactivate G proteins. We term these modules GTPase-cycle modules. The local concentrations of these proteins are spatially regulated between plasma membrane microdomains and between the plasma membrane and cytosol, but no data or models are available that quantitatively explain the effect of such regulation on signaling. We present a computational model of the GTPase-cycle module that predicts that the interplay of local G protein, R, and GAP concentrations gives rise to 16 distinct signaling regimes and numerous intermediate signaling phenomena. The regimes suggest alternative modes of the GTPase-cycle module that occur based on defined local concentrations of the component proteins. In one mode, signaling occurs while G protein and receptor are unclustered and GAP eliminates signaling; in another, G protein and receptor are clustered and GAP can rapidly modulate signaling but does not eliminate it. Experimental data from multiple GTPase-cycle modules is interpreted in light of these predictions. The latter mode explains previously paradoxical data in which GAP does not alter maximal current amplitude of G protein-activated ion channels, but hastens signaling. The predictions indicate how variations in local concentrations of the component proteins create GTPase-cycle modules with distinctive phenotypes. They provide a quantitative framework for investigating how regulation of local concentrations of components of the GTPase-cycle module affects signaling.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComputational modeling reveals how interplay between components of a GTPase-cycle module regulates signal transduction, Scott J.

In mammalian sinoatrial node, reduction or abolition of the intracellular Ca2+ transient by ryanodine, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump block or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) reduces the spontaneous rate by 21-32%, whereas in amphibian sinus venosus it abolishes spontaneous activity. In rabbit sinoatrial node, ryanodine/BAPTA reduces the T-type Ca2+ current (iCa,T), perhaps slows inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current (iCa,L), reduces the inward Na+-Ca2+ exchange current (iNaCa), and reduces the rapid and slow delayed rectifier K+ currents (iK,r and iK,s, respectively). Other evidence shows that a reduction of intracellular Ca2+ inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated current (if). These putative intracellular Ca2+-dependent changes in ionic currents have been incorporated into different models of rabbit sinoatrial node action potentials. In the models, block of the Ca2+ transient reduced the spontaneous rate by 24 and 26% in the central and peripheral models of Zhang and others, 13% in the Oxsoft model (Noble et al.), 9% in the model of Wilders and others, and 41% in the model of Demir and others. In all models, the reduction in rate was not primarily the result of the decrease in iNaCa, but instead the combination of all changes in ionic currents.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nControl of the pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node by intracellular Ca2+.

A two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min, synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good agreement with values from previous reports. The difference between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min). The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably estimated from a single model.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the components and variables in a mathematical model of human melatonin.

Despite not incorporating independent descriptions for each of the known currents measured through the cell membrane, the model is however capable to correctly reproduce both the healthy and pathological conditions of the epicardial tissue layer, the latter being characterized by the presence of a much deeper notch in the cardiac action potential as a result of a loss of functionality of sodium channels which leaves unopposed the transient outward potassium current.\n\n\n\n\nDespite being able of reproducing a great amount of available experimental data, one important limitation of the proposed minimal model is that it lacks of a complete description of intracellular calcium dynamics. Hence, the model cannot be used to study particular conditions of importance in the generation and development of arrhythmias, such as calcium overload, spontaneous calcium release or calcium-induced alternans. This limitation could be overcome however by coupling our simplified model of the cardiac transmembrane potential to a reduced model of the intracellular calcium cycling of the ventricular myocyte, such as the one suggested by Shiferaw et al. (2003), therefore yielding the first implementation of a second-generation simplified ionic model of the cardiac myocyte.\n\n\n\n\nThis model was taken from the PhD thesis of Alfonso Bueno:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical modeling and spectral simulation of genetic diseases in the human heart, Alfonso Bueno, Department of Mathematics, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, May 2007.\n\n\n\n\n",

An aortic blood pressure signal (the driving signal for the model) is transduced by afferent baroreceptor nerve fibers in the wall of the aortic arch into a neural (firing rate) signal. This transduction process is governed by mechanical strain in the wall of the aorta. This neural signal is then relayed and further processed by the central and peripheral nervous systems into parallel sympathetic and parasympathetic tone signals. Sympathetic and parasympathetic tones drive release of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively, into the neuromuscular junction of the sinoatrial node of the heart, thereby modulating the pacemaker activity at the sinoatrial node.

Please note that the model has to be run for a duration of 10000 ms with a step size of 0.01 ms and a high point density of 100000 points/graph. This model represents model 1 from the published paper (which does not include a slow potassium current).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current INaP-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current INaP and slow activation of a K+ current IKS. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-BotC oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to >1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModels of Respiratory Rhythm Generation in the Pre-Botzinger Complex.

In this paper, we investigate the frequency control and synchronization of these model neurons when coupled by excitatory amino-acid-mediated synapses and controlled by convergent synaptic inputs modeled as tonic excitation. Simulations of pairs of identical cells reveal that increasing tonic excitation increases the frequency of synchronous bursting, while increasing the strength of excitatory coupling between the neurons decreases the frequency of synchronous bursting. Low levels of coupling extend the range of values of tonic excitation where synchronous bursting is found. Simulations of a heterogeneous population of 50-500 bursting neurons reveal coupling effects similar to those found experimentally in vitro: coupling increases the mean burst duration and decreases the mean burst frequency. Burst synchronization occurred over a wide range of intrinsic frequencies (0.1-1 Hz) and even in populations where as few as 10% of the cells were intrinsically bursting. Weak coupling, extreme parameter heterogeneity, and low levels of depolarizing input could contribute to the desynchronization of the population and give rise to quasiperiodic states. The introduction of sparse coupling did not affect the burst synchrony, although it did make the interburst intervals more irregular from cycle to cycle. At a population level, both parameter heterogeneity and excitatory coupling synergistically combine to increase the dynamic input range: robust synchronous bursting persisted across a much greater range of parameter space (in terms of mean depolarizing input) than that of a single model cell. This extended dynamic range for the bursting cell population indicates that cellular heterogeneity is functionally advantageous. Our modeled system accounts for the range of intrinsic frequencies and spiking patterns of inspiratory (I) bursting cells found in the Pre-Botzinger complex in neonatal rat brain stem slices in vitro. There is a temporal dispersion in the spiking onset times of neurons in the population, predicted to be due to heterogeneity in intrinsic neuronal properties, with neurons starting to spike before (pre-I), with (I), or after (late-I) the onset of the population burst. Experimental tests for a number of the model's predictions are proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| The single cell neuron model is based on a single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type formalism.

In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations. The model can be used to predict the phenotypes of novel mutations and effective ranges of the unmeasured rate constants and transport coefficients in the proposed mechanism.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Dynamical modeling of syncytial mitotic cycles in Drosophila embryos, Laurence Calzone, Denis Thieffry, John J Tyson, Bela Novak, 2007, \n *Molecular Systems Biology*\n , 3, 131.

This autonomous regulation is most dramatic in asynchronous insect flight muscle and gives rise to wing beat frequencies that exceed the frequency capacity of neural motor control systems. Stretch activation in insect flight muscle allows the contractile features of the flight muscle to be matched and tuned to the wing-thorax-aerodynamic load to ensure proper muscle contraction frequency and effort for flight (Pringle, 1977); a role for which intrinsic autonomous regulation is especially suited. In stretch-sensitive insect flight muscles, neurally controlled intracellular calcium plays a permissive role (it needs to be present at adequate levels to allow the intrinsic stretch activation mechanisms to operate) but it is not the dominant player in force generation or in work production. That role belongs to stretch itself, which activates the myofilament system in such a way (i.e., with appropriate phase delay) to generate force and perform rhythmic work. \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Function of Stretch Activation in Heart Muscle, Kenneth B.

A convenient method to explore some of these models is to grab the source workspace and use the [OpenCOR Jupyter notebook interface](https://opencor.github.io/userInterfaces/commandLineInterfacePythonRelatedScripts.html) to launch the `Cardiac Cellular Electrophysiological Modelling.ipynb` notebook. We provide here step-by-step instructions for achieving this.\n\n\n\n### 1. Install OpenCOR\n\n\nThe Jupyter notebook is known to work with OpenCOR 14 September 2021 Snapshot, development and testing performed on the Windows version of OpenCOR. Any newer version should also work. Older versions may not. OpenCOR can be downloaded from: <https://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html>\n\n\n### 2. Grab this workspace\n\n\nThe easiest method is to look for this PMR exposure in the OpenCOR PMR browser and make a local copy using OpenCOR.\n\n\n\n First, make sure you have the `PMR` window visible in OpenCOR. Then filter for \"cardiac cellular electrophysiological...\" and you should see this exposure in the filtered list as shown below.  \n\n![](jupyter-images/opencor-pmr-workspace.png)\n\n\n\n\n Once you can see this workspace listed, a right click should give the menu option to `Make a Local Copy` as shown below.  \n\n![](jupyter-images/opencor-pmr-workspace-clone.png)   \n\n You will then be prompted for where to store the local copy - this should be a new empty folder. It might take a few minutes to make the local copy.\n\n\n\n\n If you're happy with Git, just go ahead and `git clone https://teaching.physiomeproject.org/workspace/a1`\n\n\n\n### Launch the OpenCOR Jupyter notebook\n\n\n\n Open up a console on your machine. On Windows this is the Command Prompt: `cmd`. Once you have a console, change into the folder where you made a local copy of this workspace:  \n\n`C:\\Users\\andre> cd \"C:\\Users\\andre\\cellml models\"`  \n\n And then launch the OpenCOR Jupyter notebook:  \n\n`C:\\Users\\andre\\cellml models> \"c:\\Program Files\\OpenCOR\\jupyternotebook.bat\"`  \n\n The specific location and command will depend on how you installed OpenCOR and your operating system. See the [OpenCOR documentation](https://opencor.github.io/userInterfaces/commandLineInterfacePythonRelatedScripts.html) for further details.\n\n\n\n\n When you run the OpenCOR Jupyter notebook command, it should automatically open the notebook server in your web browser and you should see a page like that shown below.  \n\n[![](jupyter-images/launch.png)](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/709/jupyter-images/launch.png)  \n\n This shows the default `a1` folder, but you should see the folder that you saved the workspace to, and you can then navigate into that folder to see the workspace content.\n\n\n\n\n Once you navigate into the workspace folder you should see a listing of the workspace content. From there, you can launch the Jupyter notebook `Cardiac Cellular Electrophysiological Modelling.ipynb` as shown below.  \n\n[![](jupyter-images/jupyter-workspace.png)](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/709/jupyter-images/jupyter-workspace.png)\n\n\n\n\n Which should then open the notebook and show something similar to the below.  \n\n[![](jupyter-images/jupyter-notebook.png)](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/709/jupyter-images/jupyter-notebook.png)\n\n\n\n\n From there, it is possible to use the `Cell` menu to \"Run All\" to simply run the whole notebook, or to manually step through the notebook executing each step as you go.\n\n\n\n\n",

These modifications were driven by new sets of experimental data available from the literature and the analysis of several well-established cellular arrhythmic risk biomarkers, namely AP duration at 90 per cent repolarization (APD90), AP triangulation, calcium dynamics, restitution properties, APD90 adaptation to abrupt heart rate changes, and rate dependence of intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. The proposed methodology represents a novel framework for the development of cardiac cell models. Five stimulation protocols were applied to the original model and the ventricular AP model developed here to compute the described arrhythmic risk biomarkers. In addition, those models were tested in a one-dimensional fibre in which hyperkalaemia was simulated by increasing the extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o. The effective refractory period (ERP), conduction velocity (CV) and the occurrence of APD alternans were investigated. Results show that modifications improved model behaviour as verified by: (i) AP triangulation well within experimental limits (the difference between APD at 50 and 90 per cent repolarization being 78.1 ms); (ii) APD90 rate adaptation dynamics characterized by fast and slow time constants within physiological ranges (10.1 and 105.9 ms); and (iii) maximum S1S2 restitution slope in accordance with experimental data (SS1S2=1.0). In simulated tissues under hyperkalaemic conditions, APD90 progressively shortened with the degree of hyperkalaemia, whereas ERP increased once a threshold in [K+]o was reached ([K+]o= 6 mM). CV decreased with [K+]o, and conduction was blocked for [K+]o>10.4 mM. APD90 alternans were observed for [K+]o>9.8 mM. Those results adequately reproduce experimental observations. This study demonstrated the value of basing the development of AP models on the computation of arrhythmic risk biomarkers, as opposed to joining together independently derived ion channel descriptions to produce a whole-cell AP model, with the new framework providing a better picture of the model performance under a variety of stimulation conditions. On top of replicating experimental data at single-cell level, the model developed here was able to predict the occurrence of APD90 alternans and areas of conduction block associated with high [K+]o in tissue, which is of relevance for the investigation of the arrhythmogenic substrate in ischaemic hearts.\n\n\n",

Since LHRH stimulates the release of LH, and LH in turn stimulates the release of testosterone, the three hormones constitute a three-component \"feedback\" network. We show how this model is able to account for the pulsatility of the release of these three hormones. Furthermore, the model is consistent with results obtained from a wide range of experimental manipulations of the system. For example, it accounts for the changes observed in hormone release patterns after castration. In particular, it follows that no \"neural clock\", or \"neural pulse-generator\", is required to force the system into pulsatile behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the mathematical model representing the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone system.

For model representations of the late distal tublule, these initial values should be replaced with those listed in the orginal paper for the late distal tubule. The model from the original paper has been modified slightly to include differential equations defining the change in solute concentrations over time.

Transport rates were calculated using kinetic equations. Axial heterogeneity was represented by partitioning the model into two subsegments with different sets of model parameters.

We have previously reported a model that deals with transport of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), and water in this nephron segment (Chang H and Fujita T. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 276: F931-F951, 1999). In this study, we extend our previous model by incorporating buffer systems, new cell types, and new transport mechanisms. Specifically, the model incorporates bicarbonate, ammonium, and phosphate buffer systems; has cell types corresponding to intercalated cells; and includes the Na/H exchanger, H-ATPase, and anion exchanger. Incorporation of buffer systems has required the following modifications of model equations: new model equations are introduced to represent chemical equilibria of buffer partners [e.g., pH = pK(a) + log(10) (NH(3)/NH(4))], and the formulation of mass conservation is extended to take into account interconversion of buffer partners. Furthermore, finite rates of H(2)CO(3)-CO(2) interconversion are taken into account in modeling the bicarbonate buffer system. Owing to this treatment, the model can simulate the development of disequilibrium pH in the distal tubular fluid. For each new transporter, a state diagram has been constructed to simulate its transport kinetics. With appropriate assignment of maximal transport rates for individual transporters, the model predictions are in agreement with free-flow micropuncture experiments in terms of HCO reabsorption rate in the normal state as well as under the high bicarbonate load. Although the model cannot simulate all of the microperfusion experiments, especially those that showed a flow-dependent increase in HCO reabsorption, the model is consistent with those microperfusion experiments that showed HCO reabsorption rates similar to those in the free-flow micropuncture experiments. We conclude that it is possible to develop a numerical model of the rat distal tubule that simulates acid-base transport, as well as basic solute and water transport, on the basis of tubular geometry, physical principles, and transporter kinetics. Such a model would provide a useful means of integrating detailed kinetic properties of transporters and predicting macroscopic transport characteristics of this nephron segment under physiological and pathophysiological settings. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA numerical model of acid-base transport in rat distal tubule, Hangil Chang and Toshiro Fujita, 2001, *American Journal of Physiology*, 281, F222-F243.

In excitable cells such as neurons, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is brought about by the Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane when these channels open during depolarisation, permitting extracellular Ca2+ to enter the cell. By contrast, in non-excitable cells Ca2+ is supplied mainly by internal stores. These stores release Ca2+ when neurotransmitters and hormones engage in the phospholinositide signalling pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\nOscillatory signals in [Ca2+]i in non-excitable cells are frequency encoded. These patterns are similar to action potential responses observed in excitable cells upon stimulation. A model exclusively studied in this paper is based on the receptor-operated model of Cuthberson and Chay (1991) (see below). The essence of this model is that the resting period between the Ca2+ spikes are timed by the build up of GTP-binding proteins combined with positive feedback effects and co-operation, leading to the sudden activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Activated PLC converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nAppearance of phase-locked wenckebach-like rhythms, devil's staircase and universality in intracellular calcium spikes in non-excitable cell models, Teresa Ree Chay, Young Seek Lee and Yin Shui Fan, 1995, \n *Journal Of Theoretical Biology*\n , 174, 21-44.

PLC is an effector which is activated when bound to G-alpha-GTP. The exchange of GTP for bound GDP is catalysed by the hormone-receptor complex R*, with the help of the G-beta-gamma subunit. Hydrolysis of the bound GTP brings the G-protein back to the inactive state. GTP hydrolysis by the G-alpha\\_GTP complexed with PLC is much faster than that of G-alpha-GTP alone. The model is based on these four reaction steps. |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| The Ca2+-phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway plays a major role in transmembrane signalling in a large number of different cell types.

In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1-3 and Clb1-6) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling \"Start\" (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and \"Finish\" (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in budding yeast.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Kinetic Analysis of a Molecular Model of the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, Katherine C.

Central to the checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive, its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis checkpoint, like other checkpoints, raises the cell size threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Mathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast, Andrea Ciliberto, Bela Novak, and John J.

Cdk1 activity peaks at mitosis, driven by periodic degradation of cyclins A and B. In contrast, Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, despite a constant level of its partner, cyclin E. Cyclin E degrades at a fixed time after fertilization, normally corresponding to the midblastula transition. Based on published data and new experiments, we constructed a mathematical model in which: (1) oscillations in Cdk2 activity depend upon changes in phosphorylation, (2) Cdk2 participates in a negative feedback loop with the inhibitory kinase Wee1; (3) cyclin E is cooperatively removed from the oscillatory system; and (4) removed cyclin E is degraded by a pathway activated by cyclin E/Cdk2 itself. The model's predictions about embryos injected with Xic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E/Cdk2, were experimentally validated.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A kinetic model of the cyclin E/Cdk2 developmental timer in *Xenopus laevis* embryos, Andrea Ciliberto, Matthew J.

The removal step is cooperative in that the more cyclin E/Cdk2 there is bound to the dashed box, the faster is the association reaction.

S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, called the G1 and G2 phases respectively. However, in early development, when the main aim of embryo is to increase cell number by a series of rapid cell divisions, the cell cycle has a number of unique features: \n\n\n\n* interdivision time is short and nearly constant;\n* S and M phases alternate in time without intervening G1 or G2 phases;\n* cell division is nearly synchronous and most cells take part;\n* and the nucleocytoplasmic ration (NCR) of cells increases dramatically.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the NCR controls the cell cycle characteristics during the early stages of devlopment. This idea has been incorporated into the following mathematical model of early devlopmental cell cycle control. \n\n\n\n\nThe molecular components involved in mitotic control have been studied extensively in the last decade, and a control system, common to all eukaryotes, has been elucidated. This has been the subject of several mathematical models, including models which use budding yeast as the experimental organism: \n\n\n\n* [Modelling the control of DNA replication in fission yeast, Novak and Tyson, 1997](http://www.cellml.org/models/novak_tyson_1997_version01)\n* [Mathematical Model of the Fission Yeast Cell Cycle, Novak *et al.*, 1998](http://www.cellml.org/models/novak_csikasz-nagy_gyorffy_chen_tyson_1998_version01)\n* [Chen *et al.*, Modelling the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/chen_csikasz-nagy_gyorffy_val_novak_tyson_2000_version02)\n* [Ciliberto *et al.* Modelling the Morphogenesis Checkpoint in the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, 2003](http://www.cellml.org/models/ciliberto_novak_tyson_2003_version01)\n\n\n\nand those which use the Xenopus oocyte and embryo: [Ciliberto *et al.* A Kinetic Model of the Cyclin E/Cdk2 Developmental Timer in *Xenopus laevis* embryos, 2003](http://www.cellml.org/models/ciliberto_petrus_tyson_sible_2003_version01).\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ciliberto and Tyson 2000 publication described here, the authors develop a mathematical model based on the molecular interactions underlying early embryonic cell cycle control (see \n the figure\n below).

LQT2 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT interval on the ECG. METHODS: We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr) channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the cardiac ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect results in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the time course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG can lead to impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding of the link between channel structure and cellular function.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCellular consequences of HERG mutations in the long QT syndrome: precursors to sudden cardiac death, Colleen E.

A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nNa+ Channel Mutation That Causes Both Brugada and Long-QT Syndrome Phenotypes: A Simulation Study of Mechanism, Colleen E.

        "description": "\n\n \n An initial attempt to demonstrate one use of CellML with multicellular models using the Delta-Notch model of Collier et al (1996) as an example. In the current state of this workspace, I show the two cell variant of the Collier model as described in Figure 3 of the [Collier article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9015458). In this encoding of the model, we use CellML 1.1 to separate the single cell dynamics from the population model. In the single cell model I have encoded the two ODEs which make up the dynamics (Equation 2 in the Collier paper) and left the initial conditions and parameters undefined. The population model (collier-2cell.xml) uses the CellML import feature to *\"instantiate\"* two cells, as shown in the diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n![](collier-2cell-hierarchy.png)\n  \nModel hierarchy (generated using [CellML2Dot](http://cellml.sourceforge.net/CellML2Dot)) of the two cell variant of the Collier et al Delta-Notch signalling model.\n\n\n The two single cell models are then connected together in the two cell variant of the Collier model. The parent model defines the parameters to be used in both instances of the single cell model along with the different initial conditions for each cell. I define a neighbourhood average for delta for each of the cells, which for the two cell variant simply consists of the delta value from the other cell and the zero boundary condition. The connections between the single cell models can be seen in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n![](collier-2cell-variable-connections.png)\n  \nModel connections (generated using [CellML2Dot](http://cellml.sourceforge.net/CellML2Dot)) of the two cell variant of the Collier et al Delta-Notch signalling model. The common model parameters can be seen as well as the initial conditions for the individual cells.\n\n\n Simulations of the two cell variant of the Collier model can be performed to demonstrate that the model is correctly encoded. A reproduction of the results from Figure 3 of the Collier et al (1996) article can be seen below, using the two cell variant as encoded in CellML.\n\n\n\n\n![](collier-2cell-graph.png)\n  \nSimulation results (generated using [CellMLSimulator](http://cellml.sourceforge.net/CellMLSimulator)) of the two cell variant of the Collier Delta-Notch signalling model.

        "description": "\n**Abstract**\n------------\n\n\nThe clear importance of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as an in-vitro model highlights the relevance of studying these cells and their function also in-silico. Moreover, the phenotypical differences between the hiPSC-CM and adult myocyte action potentials (APs) call for understanding of how hiPSC-CMs are maturing towards adult myocytes. Using recently published experimental data, we developed two computational models of the hiPSC-CM action potential (AP), distinguishing between the ventricular-like and atrial-like phenotypes, emerging during the differentiation process of hiPSC-CMs. Also, we used the computational approach to quantitatively assess the role of ionic mechanisms which are likely responsible for the not completely mature phenotype of hiPSC-CMs. Our models reproduce the typical hiPSC-CM ventricular-like and atrial-like spontaneous APs and the response to prototypical current blockers, namely tetrodotoxine, nifedipine, E4041 and 3R4S-Chromanol 293B. Moreover, simulations using our ventricular-like model suggest that the interplay of immature INa, If and IK1 currents has a fundamental role in the hiPSC-CM spontaneous beating whereas a negative shift in ICaL activation causes the observed long lasting AP. In conclusion, this work provides two novel tools useful in investigating the electrophysiological features of hiPSC-CMs, whose importance is growing fast as in-vitro models for pharmacological studies.\n\n\n### Pubmed Link: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722932>\n\n\n**COR specifics**\n-----------------\n\n\nTwo different model versions are avaible, respectively marked as Atrial and Ventricular in the Files section.\n\n\nThe Ventricular version includes a compartment for the simulation of a stimulus current injection and one for the simulation of the effect of current blockers.\n\n\nTo simulate the presence of stimulus current:\n\n\n* the 'stim\\_flag' constant in the 'stim\\_mode' compartment needs to be set to 1.\n* 'i\\_stim\\_Amplitude' sets the stimulus intensity expressed in Ampere\n* 'i\\_stim\\_start' sets the current injection starting time in Seconds\n* 'i\\_stim\\_end' sets the current injection stop time in Seconds\n* 'i\\_stim\\_frequency' sets the number of stimulation pulses per minute (es. 60 means 1Hz stimulation)\n* 'i\\_stim\\_PulseDuration' sets the pulse duration in Seconds\n\n\nTo simulate the effects of current blockers, one of the corresponding flags in the 'current\\_blockers' compatment need to be set to 1.

This model was produced using the parameter values on page 360. This file is known to run on COR 0.9 and Open Cell.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nNumerous top-down kinetic models have been constructed to describe the cell cycle. These models have typically been constructed, validated and analyzed using model species (molecular intermediates and proteins) and phenotypic observations, and therefore do not focus on the individual model processes (reaction steps). We have developed a method to: (a) quantify the importance of each of the reaction steps in a kinetic model for the positioning of a switch point [i.e. the restriction point (RP)]; (b) relate this control of reaction steps to their effects on molecular species, using sensitivity and co-control analysis; and thereby (c) go beyond a correlation towards a causal relationship between molecular species and effects. The method is generic and can be applied to responses of any type, but is most useful for the analysis of dynamic and emergent responses such as switch points in the cell cycle. The strength of the analysis is illustrated for an existing mammalian cell cycle model focusing on the RP [Novak B, Tyson J (2004) J Theor Biol230, 563-579]. The reactions in the model with the highest RP control were those involved in: (a) the interplay between retinoblastoma protein and E2F transcription factor; (b) those synthesizing the delayed response genes and cyclin D/Cdk4 in response to growth signals; (c) the E2F-dependent cyclin E/Cdk2 synthesis reaction; as well as (d) p27 formation reactions. Nine of the 23 intermediates were shown to have a good correlation between their concentration control and RP control. Sensitivity and co-control analysis indicated that the strongest control of the RP is mediated via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex concentration. Any perturbation of the RP could be related to a change in the concentration of this complex; apparent effects of other molecular species were indirect and always worked through cyclin E/Cdk2:p27, indicating a causal relationship between this complex and the positioning of the RP.\n\n\nRestriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex, Conradie R, Bruggeman F J, Ciliberto A, Csikasz-Nagy A, Novak B, Westerhoff H V, Snoep J L *FEB Journal*, 277, 357-367[PubMed ID: 20015233](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015233)\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Time course of the mammalian cell division cycle. A time integration for 30 h is shown for six of the intermediates of the system. The G1-, S/G2- and M-phases for one cell cycle are indicated in the graph. The RP is also depicted in the G1-phase. It should be noted that, in contrast to other switch points in the model, the RP is not a hard coded event (i.e. it is not an explicit function, but rather an emergent property of the model), and it is empirically defined as the last time point where, upon cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, the cell would not finish the division cycle it started with. The CHX treatment was mimicked in the model by reducing the translation efficiency of the ribosomes [e or Eps(t)], a parameter found in all synthesis steps of the model, from 1.0 to 0.5. This definition was taken from the original publication in which the model was described [5]. |\n\n\n\n",

It also passes the online PyCml validation tests with no errors or warnings. This model includes the specification of four pseudo ICC stimulus pulses with a 20s period. More information and simulation results can be found at the [Computational Bioengineering Laboratory](http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/compbiolab/projects/gi-project.html#sm-cell-ephys).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nThe coordinated activity of the enteric nervous system (ENS), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and smooth muscle (SM) cells is required to generate gastric motility. While the ICC provide a constant source of electrical activity, and can be regarded as the *pacemaker* of the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the ENS adds an extra level of control. In combination the ICC and ENS act as a stimulus, causing the SM cells to contract and generate slow wave activity in the GI. These regular, autonomous depolarisations are then propagated via gap junctions to the neighbouring SM cells in the gut wall. \n\n\n\n\nSM cells themselves are unable to generate or propagate slow waves autonomously. Instead they response to the electrical stimuli generated by neighbouring ICC as voltage-dependent ion channels embedded within their cell surface membrane become activated and other extracellular ligands and intracellular second messengers (such as calcium ions) also modify the response of the SM cells. As such, the inherent complexity of such a system quickly becomes apparent, and the role of mathematical models in dissecting the system and characterising the different functions of each individual component becomes clear. However, while computational models of cardiac electrophysiology have advanced considerably over the past few years, to date, models of gastric electrophysiology have been limited by the absence of single cell models which form the foundation for the more complex, large scale, integrated models. \n\n\n\n\nIn the present study Alberto Corrias and Martin Buist address this issue by presenting an electrophysiolgical model of a single gastric SM cell. The model parameters are based on real, experimentally recorded, physiological data, and the model has also been kept relatively simple to make it computationally efficient, and therefore suitable for embedding within multicellular simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model. |\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA quantitative model of gastric smooth muscle cellular activation, Alberto Corrias and Martin L.

The major ion channels that have been identified as influencing slow wave activity have been modeled according to data obtained from isolated ICC.

Unfortunately the model will not integrate at the moment. We are working with the model author to complete the curation of this model.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nThe high metabolic rate of cardiac tissue necessitates close agreement between the rates of energy production and consumption. About 2 percent of cellular ATP is consumed per heartbeat, and under normal conditions, almost all of this energy is provided by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Although the chemiosmotic theory of energy transduction was developed by Michell in 1961, remarkably little has since been elucidated about the mechanisms underlying the control of mitochondrial metabolism. \n\n\n\n\nThe thermokinetic model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics (see \n the figure\n below). The kinetic portion of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH2. In turn, these are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force driving the F1F0-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, determined by Ca2+ uniporter and Ca2+/Na+ exchanger activities, controls the activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Model simulations are used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of ATP/ADP exchange, and Ca2+ concentration. Model simulations are able to reproduce experimental data, which was taken as supporting evidence for the validity of the model. The steady-state and time-dependent behaviour of the model supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes. \n\n\n\n\nPreviously published models of mitochondrial energetics include the models of pancreatic beta-cell mitochondrial metabolism by Magnus and Keizer (see [Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling Model, 1997](http://www.cellml.org/models/magnus_keizer_1997_version01)). An oxidative phosphorylation model has been developed by Korzeniewski (see [The Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway, 2001](http://www.cellml.org/models/beard_2005_version01)). However, these models, in common with other previously developed models of mitochondrial energetics, fail to include all the necessary variables. Together with the desire to improve understanding of mitochondrial metabolism, this has led Cortassa *et al.* to develop an integrated kinetic and thermodynamic model of cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism. Their model has been described here in CellML (the raw CellML description of the Cortassa *et al.* model can be downloaded in various formats as described in ). \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[An Integrated Model of Cardiac Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism and Calcium Dynamics](http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/4/2734), Sonia Cortassa, Miguel A.

Cell-wide synchronized oscillations in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), NADH, and ROS production have been recently described in isolated cardiomyocytes, and we have hypothesized that the balance between superoxide anion efflux through inner membrane anion channels and the intracellular ROS scavenging capacity play a key role in the oscillatory mechanism. Here, we formally test the hypothesis using a computational model of mitochondrial energetics and Ca(2+) handling including mitochondrial ROS production, cytoplasmic ROS scavenging, and ROS activation of inner membrane anion flux. The mathematical model reproduces the period and phase of the observed oscillations in Delta Psi(m), NADH, and ROS. Moreover, we experimentally verify model predictions that the period of the oscillator can be modulated by altering the concentration of ROS scavengers or the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, and that the redox state of the glutathione pool oscillates. In addition to its role in cellular dysfunction during metabolic stress, the period of the oscillator can be shown to span a wide range, from milliseconds to hours, suggesting that it may also be a mechanism for physiological timekeeping and/or redox signaling.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Mitochondrial Oscillator Dependent on Reactive Oxygen Species, Sonia Cortassa, Miguel A.

A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools.

The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (C(J)v1) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (R(J)DHAP= 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (R(J)ATP = -0.21 to -0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (R(J)NADH = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMetabolic Control Analysis of Glycerol Synthesis in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*\n , Garth R.

Using \none-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell cycle, how cell-size \nhomeostasis can be achieved by two different strategies, and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual \ncell-division phenotypes. The relation between gene dosage and phenotype can be summarized compactly in two-parameter \nbifurcation diagrams.

In this particular version of the model the zinc-buffering effects of TPEN are NOT considered.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli is one of the most intensively studied prokaryotic zinc homeostasis systems. Its underlying regulatory machine consists of repression on zinc influx through ZnuABC by Zur (Zn2+ uptake regulator) and activation on zinc efflux via ZntA by ZntR (a zinc-responsive regulator). Although these transcriptional regulations seem to be well characterized, and there is an abundance of detailed in vitro experimental data available, as yet there is no mathematical model to help interpret these data. To our knowledge, the work described here is the first attempt to use a mathematical model to simulate these regulatory relations and to help explain the in vitro experimental data. RESULTS: We develop a unified mathematical model consisting of 14 reactions to simulate the in vitro transcriptional response of the zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. Firstly, we simulate the in vitro Zur-DNA interaction by using two of these reactions, which are expressed as 4 ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By imposing the conservation restraints and solving the relevant steady state equations, we find that the simulated sigmoidal curve matches the corresponding experimental data. Secondly, by numerically solving the ODEs for simulating the Zur and ZntR run-off transcription experiments, and depicting the simulated concentrations of zntA and znuC transcripts as a function of free zinc concentration, we find that the simulated curves fit the corresponding in vitro experimental data. Moreover, we also perform simulations, after taking into consideration the competitive effects of ZntR with the zinc buffer, and depict the simulated concentration of zntA transcripts as a function of the total ZntR concentration, both in the presence and absence of Zn(II). The obtained simulation results are in general agreement with the corresponding experimental data. CONCLUSION: Simulation results show that our model can quantitatively reproduce the results of several of the in vitro experiments conducted by Outten CE and her colleagues. Our model provides a detailed insight into the dynamics of the regulatory system and also provides a general framework for simulating in vitro metal-binding and transcription experiments and interpreting the relevant experimental data.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1999-2001, Outten *et al.* published a series of papers presenting data from several *in vitro* transcription and metal-binding competition experiments in *E. coli.* These studies provide a detailed data set on which a mathematical model can be based.

Also the CellML model appears to match the published equations.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: This work proposes a model of the metabolic branch-point between the methionine and threonine biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana which involves kinetic competition for phosphohomoserine between the allosteric enzyme threonine synthase and the two-substrate enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase. Threonine synthase is activated by S-adenosylmethionine and inhibited by AMP. Cystathionine gamma-synthase condenses phosphohomoserine to cysteine via a ping-pong mechanism. Reactions are irreversible and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. The modelling procedure included an examination of the kinetic links, the determination of the operating conditions in chloroplasts and the establishment of a computer model using the enzyme rate equations. To test the model, the branch-point was reconstituted with purified enzymes. The computer model showed a partial agreement with the in vitro results. The model was subsequently improved and was then found consistent with flux partition in vitro and in vivo. Under near physiological conditions, S-adenosylmethionine, but not AMP, modulates the partition of a steady-state flux of phosphohomoserine. The computer model indicates a high sensitivity of cystathionine flux to enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Cystathionine flux is sensitive to modulation of threonine flux whereas the reverse is not true. The cystathionine gamma-synthase kinetic mechanism favours a low sensitivity of the fluxes to cysteine. Though sensitivity to inorganic phosphate is low, its concentration conditions the dynamics of the system. Threonine synthase and cystathionine gamma-synthase display similar kinetic efficiencies in the metabolic context considered and are first-order for the phosphohomoserine substrate. Under these conditions outflows are coordinated. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Kinetic Model of the Branch-Point between the Methionine and Threonine Biosynthesis Pathways in *Arabidopsis thaliana*\n , Gilles Curien, Stephane Ravanel and Renaud Dumas, 2003, \n *European Journal of Biochemistry* \n , 270, 4615-4627.

They are in the form of an invertible Hill-type equation with the apparent Hill coefficients K(HbO2) and K(HbCO2) in the expressions for S(HbO2) and S(HbCO2) dependent on the levels of O2 and CO2 partial pressures (P(O2) and P(CO2), pH, 2,3-DPG concentration, and temperature in blood. The invertibility of these new equations allows P(O2) and P(CO2) to be computed efficiently from S(HbO2) and S(Hbco2) and vice-versa. The oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and carbamino-hemoglobin (HbCO2) dissociation curves computed from these equations are in good agreement with the published experimental and theoretical curves in the literature. The model solutions describe that, at standard physiological conditions, the hemoglobin is about 97.2% saturated by O2 and the amino group of hemoglobin is about 13.1% saturated by CO2. The O2 and CO2 content in whole blood are also calculated here from the gas solubilities, hematocrits, and the new formulas for S(HbO2) and S(HbCO2). Because of the mathematical simplicity and invertibility, these new formulas can be conveniently used in the modeling of simultaneous transport and exchange of O2 and CO2 in the alveoli-blood and blood-tissue exchange systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nBlood HbO2 and HbCO2 dissociation curves at varied O2, CO2, pH, 2,3-DPG and temperature levels, Ranjan K.

Isolated beta -cells, however, exhibit atypical bursting or continuous spike activity. We study bursting as an emergent property of the population, focussing on interactions among the subclass of spiking cells. These are modelled by equipping the fast subsystem with a saddle-node-loop bifurcation, which makes it monostable. Such cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over which bursting is seen.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nChannel Sharing in Pancreatic Beta-Cells Revisited: Enhancement of Emergent Bursting by Noise, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman, 2000,\n *The Journal Of Theoretical Biology*\n , 207, 513-530.

We have checked this model and the unit inconsistency appears to be inherent in the publication. Attempting to balance the units by changing the units of *tau* from milliseconds to picofarads results in a broken simulation output.\n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nWhen exposed to a threshold concentration of glucose, pancreatic beta-cells exhibit a complicated pattern of electrical activity. Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation. At even higher glucose concentrations, continuous action potentials are seen. This electrical activity has two important physiological correlates: increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and increased rate of insulin secretion during the active phase. It is generally accepted that the rise in [Ca2+]i plays a major role in insulin secretion and that the action potential spikes during a burst are responsible for the rise in [Ca2+]i.\n\n\n\n\nNormal bursting patterns are only observed when the beta-cells act synchronously, as they do *in vivo*, in electrically coupled organs called the islets of Langerhans. Isolated spiking cells, incapable of bursting by themselves, may generate islet-like bursting rhythms when coupled. There are three alternative hypotheses to explain why single cells and islets are different. One of these emphasises heterogeneity: single cell properties are variable, and individual cells may fall outside the narrow parameter regime required for bursting. By contrast, in coupled populations, cells with an excess of current can be balanced by cells with too little, and the population is more likely to achieve bursting. A second hypothesis focuses on noise from stochastic channel fluctuations in individual cells preventing bursting by causing premature transitions between active and silent phases. However, in large populations, fluctuations are buffered, allowing the underlying burst dynamics to be dominant. A third alternative discusses the paracrine effects of glucagon secreted by alpha-cells in the islet, on beta-cells.\n\n\n\n \nIn their 2001 paper, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman contrast the first two hypotheses. They introduce a mathematical model for bursting in pancreatic beta-cells, which is a simplified version of the biophysically based, earlier model by Sherman and Rinzel (1992). This model describes three ionic currents (see \n the figure\n below): a fast voltage-activated calcium current, ICa; a delayed rectifier potassium current, IK; and a very slow inhibitory potassium current, Is. The calcium and delayed rectifier potassium currents are responsible for generating action potentials. The slow potassium current plays no essential role in the individual cells but heterogeneity among the cells is generated by varying the value of the parameter beta. Parameter values were chosen such that the individual cells are incapable of bursting. De Vries and Sherman use their model to show bifurcation in a two-cell system, and they extrapolate this for larger clusters of coupled cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nFrom Spikers to Bursters Via Coupling: Help From Heterogeneity, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman, 2001,\n *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*\n , 63, 371-391.

This work presents a new model of the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)), the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)), the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK). Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia). Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic targets.\n \n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Decker at al. canine ventricular myocyte model (2009). |\n\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nProperties and ionic mechanisms of action potential adaptation, restitution, and accommodation in canine epicardium, Keith F.

Physiol. 266 (Cell Physiol. 35): C832-C852, 1994] of the single rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cell so that it can simulate cellular responses to bath applications of ACh and isoprenaline as well as the effects of neuronally released ACh. The model employs three different types of muscarinic receptors to explain the variety of responses observed in mammalian cardiac pacemaking cells subjected to vagal stimulation. The response of greatest interest is the ACh-sensitive change in cycle length that is not accompanied by a change in action potential duration or repolarization or hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. In this case, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is not involved. Membrane hyperpolarization occurs in response to much higher levels of vagal stimulation, and this response is also mimicked by the model. Here, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is involved. The well-known phase-resetting response of the SAN cell to single and periodically applied vagal bursts of impulses is also simulated in the presence and absence of the beta-agonist isoprenaline. Finally, the responses of the SAN cell to longer continuous trains of periodic vagal stimulation are simulated, and this can result in the complete cessation of pacemaking. Therefore, this model is 1) applicable over the full range of intensity and pattern of vagal input and 2) can offer biophysically based explanations for many of the phenomena associated with the autonomic control of cardiac pacemaking.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nParasympathetic modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity in rabbit heart: a unifying model, Semahat S.

To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to the secretion of cortisol, a mechanistic mathematical model based on current hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which provides substrate cholesterol by activating cholesterol ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, cholesterol modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this model, steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport. The transient response is dominated by a depletable pool of intracellular free cholesterol. Other inferences based on the model are presented, and a quantifiable cellular basis for increased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is proposed.\n\n\n\n\nA mechanistic model of ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion, D.P.

The c model comes from this paper and is based on equations 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 in the published paper.\n\n\nModel Structure\n---------------\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Circadian rhythms, which occur spontaneously with a period of about 24 h in a variety \nof organisms, allow their adaptation to the periodic variations of the environment. These \nrhythms are generated by a genetic regulatory network involving a negative feedback \nloop on transcription. Mathematical models based on the negative autoregulation of \ngene expression by the protein product of a clock gene account for the occurrence of self- \nsustained circadian oscillations. These models differ by their degree of complexity and, \nhence, by the number of variables considered. Some of these models can be considered as \nminimal because they contain a reduced number of biochemical processes and variables \ncapable of producing sustained oscillations. In three of these minimal models, the period \nof the oscillations significantly changes with the rate of degradation of the clock protein. \nHowever, depending on the model considered, the period increases, decreases or passes \nthrough a maximum as a function of the protein degradation rate. We clarify the \nbases for these markedly different results by bringing to light the roles of (i) protein \nphosphorylation, which is required for protein degradation, and (ii) the velocity and \ndegree of saturation of mRNA and protein degradation. Changes in the parameter values \nof the more complex of the minimal models can produce the period profiles observed in \nthe other two models. The analysis allows us to reconcile the contradictory predictions \nfor the dependence of the period on the clock protein degradation rate in three minimal \nmodels used to describe circadian rhythms. \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDependence of the period on the rate \nof protein degradation in minimal models \nfor circadian oscillations , Claude Gerard, Didier Gonze, Albert Goldbeter, 2009, *Phil.

The new model provides a review and update of existing formulations of sinoatrial node membrane currents, derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature. Simulations of spontaneous activity suggest that the dominant mechanism underlying pacemaker depolarisation is the inward background Na+ current, ib,Na. In contrast to previous models, the decay of the delayed rectifying K+ current, iK, was insignificant during this phase. Despite the presence of a pseudo-outward background current throughout the pacemaker range of potentials (Na-K pump+leak currents), the hyperpolarisation-activated current i(f) was not essential to pacemaker activity. A closer inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of the model revealed that the \"instantaneous\" time-independent current was inward for holding potentials in the pacemaker range, which rapidly became outward within 2 ms due to the inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, iCa,L. This suggests that reports in the literature in which the net background current is outward throughout the pacemaker range of potentials may be exaggerated. The magnitudes of the action potential overshoot and the maximum diastolic potential were determined largely by the reversal potentials of iCa,L and iK respectively. The action potential was sustained by the incomplete deactivation of iCa,L and the Na-Ca exchanger, iNaCa. Despite the incorporation of \"square-root\" activation by [K]o of all K+ currents, the model was unable to correctly simulate the response to elevated [K]o.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIon Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity: A New Single Cell Mathematical Model, Socrates Dokos, Branko Celler, and Nigel Lovell, 1996, \n *Theoretical Journal of Biology*\n , 181, 245-272.

This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR, and parameters for constants (beta) can be altered to produce all diagrams of figure 2 in the paper. The current parameterization is set to reproduce beta = 60% (0.6). The initial conditions Z = 0.52 and Y = 0.93 were found by allowing the model to run till steady state at 100 seconds.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nWe consider a simple, minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The model takes into account the existence of two pools of intracellular Ca2+, namely, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) whose synthesis is elicited by the stimulus, and one insensitive to InsP3. The discharge of the latter pool into the cytosol is activated by cytosolic Ca2+. Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ arise in this model either spontaneously or in an appropriate range of external stimulation; these oscillations do not require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The following properties of the model are reviewed and compared with experimental observations: (a) Control of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations by the external stimulus or extracellular Ca2+; (b) correlation of latency with period of Ca2+ oscillations obtained at different levels of stimulation; (c) effect of a transient increase in InsP3; (d) phase shift and transient suppression of Ca2+ oscillations by Ca2+ pulses, and (e) propagation of Ca2+ waves. It is shown that on all these counts the model provides a simple, unified explanation for a number of experimental observations in a variety of cell types. The model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release can be extended to incorporate variations in the level of InsP3 as well as desensitization of the InsP3 receptor; besides accounting for the phenomena described by the minimal model, the extended model might also account for the occurrence of complex Ca2+ oscillations.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the cell model for signal-induced, intracellular calcium oscillations. |\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n Signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations: properties of a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, Dupont G, Berridge M.J, Goldbeter A, 1991, *Cell Calcium*\n 12, 73-85.

J. Physiol 245) allows the possibility that the release could be at least partly regenerative. There would then be a non-linear relation between calcium current and calcium release. We have investigated this possibility in a single-cell version of the rabbit-atrial model developed by Hilgemann & Noble (1987, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 230). The model predicts different voltage ranges of activation for calcium-dependent processes (like the sodium-calcium exchange current, contraction or Fura-2 signals) and the calcium current, in agreement with the experimental results obtained by Earm et al. (1990, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 240) on exchange current tails, Cannell et al. (1987, Science, Wash. 238) by using Fura-2 signals, and Fedida et al. (1987, J. Physiol., Lond. 385) and Talo et al. (1988, Biology of isolated adult cardiac myocytes) by using contraction. However, when the Fura-2 concentration is sufficiently high (greater than 200 microM) the activation ranges become very similar as the buffering properties of Fura-2 are sufficient to remove the regenerative effect. It is therefore important to allow for the buffering properties of calcium indicators when investigating the correlation between calcium current and calcium release.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic representation of the Earm and Noble 1990 model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model of the single atrial cell: relation between calcium current and calcium release, Y.

Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this study, we characterized the role of oxytocin (OT) in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased intracellular Ca(2+). Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that express VIP receptors were identified by using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold (iv injected). OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent increase at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that VIP from the SCN contributes to the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of neuroendocrine dopaminergic and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of VIP-ergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a mathematical model.\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Egli *et al.* present a mathematical model of the mechanisms regulating the rhythmic secretion of prolactin in rats (see figure below). In this model the SCN acts as a pacemaker, controlling the activity of the hypothalamic DA and OT neurons via its rhythmic VIP secretion. In turn, the activity of these DA and OT neurons combine to determine the PRL secretory pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the network proposed to be involved in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) secretion in response to uterine cervical stimulation (CS).

The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of\nits state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the\nstate of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly\nbecause of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of\nnew cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.\n \n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\nA synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators, Michael B.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nBlood testosterone levels in human males are known to oscillate periodically with a period of a few hours. Testosterone secretion from the testes is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and the production of LH is, in turn, stimulated by the hypothalamic hormone luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) (as summarised in the figure below). Interestingly, the observed fluctuations in the blood levels of testosterone can be traced back to the pulsatile release of LHRH. Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe the pulsatile release of these three hormones. Some of these models depend on an introduced delay in one of the variables in order to create oscillations in an otherwise stable model. Examples of such delayed mathematical models include those published by Cartwright and Husain (1980) which describes the control of testosterone secretion, and also the model published by Lenbury and Pornsawad (2005) to characterise feedback control in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in humans. Both of these models have been translated into CellML and can be found in the model repository. However, while delayed models can be biologically realistic (for example there is often a delay between the secretion of a hormone and the binding of that hormone to its receptor and the subsequent response), introducing a delay to a mathematical model often comes at the expense of increased model complexity. (In particular, it should be noted that in its current form, CellML is unable to express time delays). \n\n\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Enciso and Sontag critique published mathematical models which describe testosterone dynamics.

In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na- and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30-50 mV), and approached zero at -150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for aMDG-evoked outward current (K\\_0.5\\_aMDG) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, K\\_0.5\\_aMDG for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). K\\_0.5\\_Na was similar for forward and reverse transport (~ 35mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: aMDG (1.0) > D-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > D-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: aMDG ~ D-glucose ~ D-galactose > 3-O-methylglucose.

This version of the model is for a healthy heart.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nChronic exposure of adult rats to a simulated altitude of 4500 meters is accompanied by right ventricular hypertrophy which is, at least, partially attributable to an enlargement of right ventricular myocytes. This work contributes to the understanding of cardiovascular system modifications induced by changes in the atmospheric environment.\n\n\n\n\nHypertrophied myocytes show an important increase in action potential duration, particularly at the delayed phase of the repolarisation. Although it is well known that Ito and ICaL are decreased in hypertrophied rats, we hypothesized that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current could be implied in the prolongation of action potential duration in hypertrophied cells. The electrophysiological study of myocytes was achieved using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. This configuration was obtained in two ways: the conventional broken patch technique, which allows to control the internal medium composition and to buffer the intracellular calcium, and the perforated patch technique which allows to respect the internal composition of each cell.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to test for the implication of Na+/Ca2+ exchange current, we compared the action potentials obtained in control and in hypertrophied cells, in ionic conditions where the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was either present or blocked.\n\n\n\n\nThe Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current measured in voltage clamp conditions was also compared in control and hypertrophied cells.\n\n\n\n\nOur results clearly show and implication of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current in the prolongation of action potentials recorded in hypertrophied cells. Concerning the underlying mechanisms, the voltage clamp experiments show that the increased exchanger current is induced by a modification of the driving force for the exchanger rather than by a modification of \u201cconductance\u201d or density of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger proteins. The modification of the driving force could be induced by a change in the regulation of calcium concentration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum or by the action potential duration itself.\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental data acquired in this study, were used in a mathematical simulation of the action potential (Oxsoft Heart model).

With this aim in mind, Evans *et al.* propose a compartmental model for the anti-cancer agent topotecan (TPT). The mathematical equations used to describe the physiological processes are based on biological assumptions, and the model parameters are estimated using high performance liquid chromatograpy data.\n\n\n\n\nTPT is a water soluble anti-cancer drug which has been approved for use against ovarian and small cell lung carcinomas. The drug's molecular target is DNA topoismerase I, an enzyme which resolves topological distortions in DAN by cleavage and re-ligation of one strand of the double stranded helix. TPT administration traps topoismerase I in a covalently bound intermediate complex with DNA. When the DNA replication machinary collides with this complex, the double stranded DNA breaks apart. \n\n\n\n\nThe activity of TPT is pH dependent. AT physiological pH the active form of the agent is not stable, and it undergoes reversible hydrolisis to form the more stable, inactive form. The reversible hydrolisis of TPT is first modelled by a linear, two compartment model. This simple model then forms the basis of a cell based model for drug activity in live cell experiments (see \n the figure\n below). \n\n\n\n\nThe cell based model has been described here in CellML (the raw CellML description of the Evans *et al.* 2004 model can be downloaded in various formats as described in ). \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[A mathematical model for the in vitro kinetics of the anti-cancer agent topotecan](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHX-4BY3WT5-2&_user=140507&_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2004&_alid=185337981&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6078&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=360b41bf7c9968426763a59656fa9068), Neil D.

We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nAction potential and contractility changes in [Na(+)](i) overloaded cardiac myocytes: a simulation study, Gregory M.

Dynamics of cytokine/receptor endocytic trafficking can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor down-regulation and ligand depletion, and in turn are governed by ligand/receptor binding properties. We describe here a computational model for trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) system, which is able to predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic equations describing binding, internalization, and postendocytic sorting of IL-2 and IL-2R, including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal pH, as a result of enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-a-vis degradation, and that an IL-2 analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency for stimulating the T cell proliferation response. These results are in agreement with our recent experimental findings for the IL-2 analogue termed 2D1 [Fallon, E. M. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 6790-6797]. Thus, this type of model may enable prediction of beneficial cytokine/receptor binding properties to aid development of molecular design criteria for improvements in applications such as in vivo cytokine therapies and in vitro hematopoietic cell bioreactors.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComputational Model for Effects of Ligand/Receptor Binding Properties on Interleukin-2 Trafficking Dynamics and T Cell Proliferation Response, Eric M.

Please note that the CellML model has been updated since the 2009 publication accccording the the first author's changes.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nABSTRACT: Spontaneously rhythmic pacemaker activity produced by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) is the result of the entrainment of unitary potential depolarizations generated at intracellular sites termed pacemaker units. In this study, we present a mathematical modeling framework that quantitatively represents the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics from a single ICC operating over the physiological membrane potential range. The mathematical model presented here extends our recently developed biophysically based pacemaker unit modeling framework by including mechanisms necessary for coordinating unitary potential events, such as a T-Type Ca2+ current, Vm-dependent K+ currents, and global Ca2+ diffusion. Model simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic slow wave depolarizations with an amplitude of 65 mV at a frequency of 17.4 cpm. Our model predicts that activity at the spatial scale of the pacemaker unit is fundamental for ICC slow wave generation, and Ca2+ influx from activation of the T-Type Ca2+ current is required for unitary potential entrainment. These results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ levels, particularly in the region local to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, significantly influence pacing frequency and synchronization of pacemaker unit discharge. Moreover, numerical investigations show that our ICC model is capable of qualitatively replicating a wide range of experimental observations.\n\n\nIn the study described here, Richard Faville *et al.* have developed a mathematical model of the ICC pacemaker potential. The model can be divided into two distinct components: the bulk cytoplasm and the pacemaker units. The later have been described previously (Faville *et al.*, 2008, and the CellML description of this model can be found [here](http://models.cellml.org/workspace/faville_pullan_sanders_koh_lloyd_smith_2009/@@file/a69dfff7b0d090bc51b49b5e4cda835130354d8d/faville_pacemaker_unit_2008.cellml)).

The pacemaker unit is defined and is imported into the bulk cytoplasm 10 times (note that the number of pacemaker units that could be used within the modelling framework is completely arbitrary, however 10 appears to be the minimum number required to adequately describe the pacemaker potential depolarisation). In order to embed the pacemaker model within the bulk cytoplasm modelling framework the original pacemaker model had to be modified slightly. This is because the it was only representative of pacemaker activity near the resting membrane potential of -70mV. In its modified form and embedded within the bulk cytoplasm it is now capable of simulating pacemaker activity under conditions of membrane depolarisation (Vm > -60mV). A full schematic diagram of the combined model is illustrated in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| A full schematic diagram of the bulk cytoplasm model with the imported pacemaker units illustrating all the compartmental volumes and ionic conductances, together with their interactions. |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nBiophysically based mathematical modeling of interstitial cells of Cajal slow wave activity generated from a discrete unitary potential basis, R.A.

In this study, we present a mathematical model of the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics from a single ICC pacemaker unit acting at near-resting membrane potential. This model quantitatively formalizes the framework of a novel ICC pacemaking mechanism that has recently been proposed. Model simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic UP depolarizations with an amplitude of approximately 3 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. The model predicts that the main inward currents, carried by a Ca(2+)-inhibited nonselective cation conductance, are activated by depletion of sub-plasma-membrane [Ca(2+)] caused by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration. Furthermore, pacemaker activity predicted by our model persists under simulated voltage clamp and is independent of [IP(3)] oscillations. The model presented here provides a basis to quantitatively analyze UP depolarizations and the biophysical mechanisms underlying their production.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic diagram of the pacemaker unit illustrating all the compartmental volumes and ionic conductances, together with their interactions. |\n\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Biophysically Based Mathematical Model of Unitary Potential Activity in Interstitial Cells of Cajal, R.A.

Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents (HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+ currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle. Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two K+ currents, IK1 and HERG (or IK,r), within the framework of ten Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear K+ conductances, IK1 and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human ventricular tissue and/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s) of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle. Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the human electrocardiogram.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nContributions of HERG K+ current to repolarization of the human ventricular action potential, Martin Fink, Denis Noble, Laszlo Virag, Andras Varro, and Wayne R.

Due to the change to a lumped parameter formulation, the results of this model are not expected to be comparable to the published paper, nor to any biological reality, and so the results have not been checked against any other source.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nIntracellular calcium dynamics are frequently the subject of theoretical mathematical models ([De Young and Keizer, 1992](http://www.cellml.org/models/deyoung_keizer_1992_version03), [Li and Rinzel, 1994](http://www.cellml.org/models/li_rinzel_1994_version02), [Keizer and Levine, 1996](http://www.cellml.org/models/keizer_levine_1996_version03), [Jafri-Rice-Winslow, 1998](http://www.cellml.org/models/jafri_rice_winslow_1998_version03), and [Snyder et al., 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/snyder_palmer_moore_2000_version01) are just a few examples of calcium dynamic models that have been coded up into CellML). The physical and chemical laws of calcium waves and oscillations can be expressed in terms of differential equations describing reaction kinetics, fluxes through membranes, and diffusion. \n\n\n\n \nIn this study, Charles C. Fink *et al*. produce an image-based model of a intracellular calcium wave in differentiated neuroblastoma cells (see \n the figure\n below). One important conclusion from their analysis is that neuronal morphology plays a key role in controlling and shaping the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) dynamics that underlie the calcium wave. The model is comprised of several components including: \n\n\n* *IP3 dynamics*\n -\n which account for IP3 synthesis at the plasma membrane, diffusion into the cytosol, and its degradation.\n* *Calcium dynamics*\n -\n which calculate the changing intracellular calcium concentration.\n* *Channel kinetics*\n -\n to describe calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol through an IP3-sensitive channel.\n* *SERCA pump kinetics*\n -\n to describe calcium uptake into the ER via the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps.\n* *Leak*\n -\n which models calcium leak from the ER to the cytosol.\n and\n * *Calcium buffering*\n -\n with endogenous buffers.\n\n\n \nTheir model is based on experimental data. The binding of bradykinin (BK) to its receptor initiates a G-protein cascade, activation of phospholipase C, and degradation of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to IP3. IP3 then diffuses through the cytosol from the plasma membrane to the ER where it activates Ca2+ release through the IP3R channel. The concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ rises, and is subsequently reduced as Ca2+ binds to calcium buffers and is pumped back into the ER through the SERCA. This Ca2+ wave was captured by Fink *et al*. through the use of fluorescent microscopy. The model of this process was assembled using the *Virtual Cell*, a computational system for integrating experimentally recorded image, biochemical and electrophysiological data. The model was tested by comparing several simulation results with the real experimental data, and Fink *et al*. found that there was good spatiotemporal agreement between the two data sets.\n\n\n\n \nIt should be noted that the following CellML description (for the raw CellML description of the model, see below) is not quite true to the mathematical model published in the original paper (referenced below). Currently CellML is unable to handle spatial elements, but this will hopefully be possible in the near future with the development of FieldML, an XML based language for spatially variable models. This is important, as the relative positions of the cellular components such as receptors, pumps, channels and enzymes will determine the length of diffusion pathways and therefore the rate of reactions.\n\n\n\n\n[An Image-Based Model of Calcium Waves in Differentiated Neuroblastoma Cells](http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/1/163), Charles C.

In 1994, Rogers and McCulloch modified the original model to generate a more realistic action potential. The velocity of the upstroke was increased and the large hyperpolarisation at the end of the recovery phase was removed. The model parameters were also updated. In 1996, this form of the already modified FitzHugh\\_Nagumo model was further updated by Aliev and Panfilov. They altered the equation which modelled the change of the recovery variable to provide a more realistic restitution period and to allow for reentrant phenomena.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper references are cited below:\n\n\n\n\nImpulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membrane, FitzHugh, R.A., 1961, [*Biophys.

These output neurons translate the post-synaptic potentials into a pattern of impulses whose frequency is regulated by the synaptic current. Voltage-clamp studies of retinal ganglion cells have suggested that there are at least five different ionic currents present, namely: *INa*; *ICa*; the non-activating, delayed rectifier *IK*; inactivating *IK,A*; and calcium-activated potassium currents *IK,Ca*. In 1990, Fohlmeister *et al.* developed a mathematical model of ganglion cell impulse generation which was based on these five ionic currents. The first four currents were modelled as being voltage-gated, while the fifth current, *IK,Ca*, is gated by [Ca2+]i. The basic mathematical structure of the model is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley style of cellular modelling (see [The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952](http://www.cellml.org/models/hodgkin_huxley_1952_version07) for more details). \n\n\n\n\nThis 1990 model appeared to provide a reasonably accurate representation of both the impulse waveform and repetitive firing behaviour of ganglion cells in the tiger salamander retina. Model simulations suggested that *IK,Ca* might play an important role in stabilising the cell (i.e. preventing spontaneous firing), and also in regulating the interspike period. To improve their understanding of this mechanism, in 1997, Fohlmeister and Miller combined new whole-cell experimental data together with pharmacological information and computer modelling to provide an integrated view of the experimental results, analysis, and simulation (see \n the figure\n below for a schematic diagram of their model). \n\n\n\n\nModel simulations suggested that *ICa* and *IK,Ca* do play an important role in controlling impulse frequency. But although this single compartment model was regarded as being qualitatively accurate in simulating impulse frequency behaviour and its underlying mechanisms, model limitations arose due to a lack of morphological data. This issue was addressed in a detailed, multicompartmental model of the ganglion cell, which was published in a companion paper.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Impulse Encoding Mechanisms of Ganglion Cells in the Tiger Salamander Retina](http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/78/4/1935), J.

To address this problem, we developed a new ionic model using formulations of currents based on previous models and recent experimental data. Compared with existing models, the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was decreased at depolarized potentials, the maximum conductance and rectification of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) were increased, and I(Kr) activation kinetics were slowed. The slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) was increased in magnitude and activation shifted to less positive voltages, and the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) was modified to produce a smaller, more rapidly inactivating current. Finally, a simplified form of intracellular calcium dynamics was adopted. In this model, APD alternans occurred at cycle lengths = 150-210 ms, with a maximum alternans amplitude of 39 ms. APD alternans was suppressed by decreasing I(Ca) magnitude or calcium-induced inactivation and by increasing the magnitude of I(K1), I(Kr), or I(Ks). These results establish an ionic basis for APD alternans, which should facilitate the development of pharmacological approaches to eliminating alternans.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIonic mechanism of electrical alternans, Jeffrey J.

This increase is primarily due to the opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane in response to glucose. Glucose metabolism leads to an increase in the cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio, which in turn causes the ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close. The beta-cell membrane becomes depolarised, Ca2+ channels open, and Ca2+ enters the cell. These events underlie the glucose-induced electrical activity, which in pancreatic islets, consists of Ca2+-dependent action potentials.\n\n\n\n\nThere is an abundance of literature that describes beta-cell electrical activity and its relationship to [Ca2+]i. Complex and cyclic spike-burst activity, and corresponding [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic islets and beta-cell clusters are induced in response to a rise in extracellular glucose concentration. Intermediate glucose concentrations induce both fast and slow oscillations. The authors of this current study: Fridlyand, Tamarina and Philipson, have previously studied slow and fast [Ca2+]i oscillations in islets in response to a variety of conditions. However, the experimental results were complex, and precise understanding was limited by the large number of channels and pumps in the beta-cell plasma membrane that were simultaneously working.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this behaviour, in this publication Fridlyand *et al.* have developed a mathematical model of the Ca2+ fluxes in pancreatic beta-cells. Several other mathematical models of glucose-induced insulin secretion, with corresponding descriptions of glucose transport, metabolism and ion regulation, have been published. These include:\n\n\n\n* [Extracellular and Intracellular Calcium Effects on Pancreatic Beta Cells, Chay, 1997](http://www.cellml.org/models/chay_1997_version04);\n* [Na+/Ca2+ Exchange in Models for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, Gall and Susa, 1999](http://www.cellml.org/models/gall_susa_1999_version03); and\n* [The Phantom Burster Model for Pancreatic Beta-Cells, Bertram *et al.*, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/bertram_previte_sherman_kinard_satin_2000_version02).\n\n\n\nHowever, most of these models are focused on describing one specific phenomenon. They only include a very limited set of channels and pumps, and therefore it is difficult to apply them to a another situation. In addition, since their publication, new experimental data has become available, and these new findings should be included in a theoretical model. For this reason Fridlyand *et al.* have developed the new mathematical model described here (see the raw CellML description of the Fridlyand *et al.* 2003 model in ). They have adopted the more complex style of modelling that has previously been used successfully to describe the electrophysiology of cardiac myocytes and other cell types (for example in [Human Atrial Cell Model, Nygren *et al.* 1998](https://models.physiomeproject.org/exposure/afd5db90de862fb366422bbd5e3f6744/${HTML_EXMPL_NYGREN_ATRIAL_MODEL}) and in [Modelling Interval-Force Relations in Cardiac Muscle, Rice *et al.*, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/rice_jafri_winslow_2000_version02)). \n\n\n\nTheir new model includes a wider range of channels and pumps, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sequestration mechanisms (see \n the figure\n below). Using this model they were able to simulate whole cell electrical activity and [Ca2+]i, free calcium in the ER ([Ca2+]ER), intracellular Na + ([Na+]i), cytosolic ATP ([ATP]i), and inositol triphosphate ([IP3]i) concentrations. However, they acknowledge that this model does not consider metabolic processes or insulin secretion.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Modeling of Ca2+ flux in pancreatic beta-cells: role of the plasma membrane and intracellular stores](http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/285/1/E138), Leonid E.

We modeled the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt pathway in PC12 cells on the basis of experimental results. We obtained counterintuitive results indicating that the sizes of the peak amplitudes of receptor and downstream effector phosphorylation were decoupled; weak, sustained EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, rather than strong, transient phosphorylation, strongly induced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, a molecule downstream of Akt. Using frequency response analysis, we found that a three-component Akt pathway exhibited the property of a low-pass filter and that this property could explain decoupling of the peak amplitudes of receptor phosphorylation and that of downstream effectors. Furthermore, we found that lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, converted strong, transient Akt phosphorylation into weak, sustained Akt phosphorylation, and, because of the low-pass filter characteristics of the Akt pathway, this led to stronger S6 phosphorylation than occurred in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, an EGFR inhibitor can potentially act as a downstream activator of some effectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the simple simulation model of the EGF-dependent Akt pathway. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDecoupling of receptor and downstream signals in the Akt pathway by its low-pass filter characteristics, Fujita KA, Toyoshima Y, Uda S, Ozaki Y, Kubota H, and Kuroda S, 2009, *Science Signaling*, 3, issue 132.

We have extended different single-cell models to incorporate this Ca2+-activated electrogenic Ca2+ transporter. We find that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange can provide a physiological mechanism to increase the plateau fraction as the glucose concentration is raised.

This model reproduces the curves on Figure 3, page 1047, using the corresponding initial values and the parameters found in Table S2. The variable Str has been given a value of 1 in order to show oscillatory behavior but may be changed to 0 or 2.5 for low and high values. This file is known to run on COR 0.9 and OpenCell.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nAt intermediate intensities, stress induces oscillations in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor Msn2 in budding yeast. Activation by stress results in a reversible translocation of Msn2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This translocation is negatively controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway through Msn2 phosphorylation. Here we show that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Msn2 is necessary and sufficient to promote the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor. Because the NLS is controlled by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, we use a computational model to investigate the possibility that the cAMP-PKA pathway could function as an oscillator driving the periodic shuttling of Msn2. The model indicates that sustained oscillations of cAMP can indeed occur in a range bounded by two critical values of stress intensity, owing to the negative feedback exerted by PKA on cAMP accumulation.

More recently, models of the atria have started to emerge, and there is much interest in addressing sinoatrial node structure and function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We implemented a variety of one-dimensional sinoatrial models consisting of descriptions of central, transitional, and peripheral sinoatrial node cells, as well as rabbit or human atrial cells. These one-dimensional models were implemented using CMISS on an SGI Origin 2000 supercomputer. Intercellular coupling parameters recorded in experimental studies on sinoatrial node and atrial cell-pairs under-represent the electrotonic interactions that any cardiomyocyte would have in a multidimensional setting. Unsurprisingly, cell-to-cell coupling had to be scaled-up (by a factor of 5) in order to obtain a stable leading pacemaker site in the sinoatrial node center. Further critical parameters include the gradual increase in intercellular coupling from sinoatrial node center to periphery, and the presence of electrotonic interaction with atrial cells. Interestingly, the electrotonic effect of the atrium on sinoatrial node periphery is best described as opposing depolarization, rather than necessarily hyperpolarizing, as often assumed. CONCLUSION: Multicellular one-dimensional models of sinoatrial node and atrium can provide useful insight into the origin and spread of normal cardiac excitation. They require larger than \"physiologic\" intercellular conductivities in order to make up for a lack of \"anatomical\" spatial scaling. Multicellular models for more in-depth quantitative studies will require more realistic anatomico-physiologic properties.\n\n\n\n\nNote: There is a second variable which varies between models; version. If version=0 the CellML model behaves like the Zhang et al. 2000 model. If version=1 the CellML model describes a 0D capable, or suitable for single cell modelling, and if version=2 the CellML model describes a 1D capable, or suitable for multicellular modelling.

The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D/Cdk4-6 in G(1), cyclin E/Cdk2 at the G(1)/S transition, cyclin A/Cdk2 in S and at the S/G(2) transition, and cyclin B/Cdk1 at the G(2)/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nTemporal self-organization of the cyclin/Cdk network\ndriving the mammalian cell cycle.

Increased glucose concentration also induces rhythmical electrical activity in beta cells. This activity consists of the periodic plateaus and spikes of Ca2+-dependent action potentials, which enhance Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Two KCa channels are present in beta cells: a voltage dependent, \"fast\", large conductance KCa, and a slowly activating and deactivating KCa current, Kslow. Kslow is thought to be responsible for islet pacemaking. \n\n\n\n\nExperimental data suggest that both cytosolic calcium and calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play an essential role in the activation of Kslow channels. In their 2002 paper, P.B. Goforth, R. Bertram, F.A. Khan, M. Zhang, A. Sherman, and L.S. Satin develop two mathematical models to test this theory (see \n the figure\n below). Their first minimal model lacks a separate subspace, and they found that this two component model (cytosol and ER) was insufficient to explain Ca2+-induced activation of Kslow channels. However, their second model incorporated a localised pool of Ca2+ in a subspace located between the plasma membrane and the ER. In this model, subspace [Ca2+] is positively correlated with changes in cytosolic [Ca2+], but with a gradient that reflects Ca2+ efflux from the ER.

Taking into account recent experimental observations, the model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and on the negative feedback exerted by PER on the transcription of the period (per) gene. This minimal biochemical model provides a molecular basis for circadian oscillations of the limit cycle type. During oscillations, the peak in per mRNA precedes by several hours the peak in total PER protein. The results support the view that multiple PER phosphorylation introduces times delays which strengthen the capability of negative feedback to produce oscillations. The analysis shows that the rhythm only occurs in a range bounded by two critical values of the maximum rate of PER degradation. A similar result is obtained with respect to the rate of PER transport into the nucleus. The results suggest a tentative explanation for the altered period of per mutants, in terms of variations in the rate of PER degradation.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Model for Circadian Oscillations in the Drosophila Period Protein (PER), Albert Goldbeter, 1995, *Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences*, 261, 319-324.

The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. & Stryer, L. (1988) *Proc. Matl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055*], the present model, which contains only two variable, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. & Takeshita, S. (1981) *J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031*] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behaviour and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phospohorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.\n\n\nMinimla model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations and for their frequency encoding through protein phosphorylation, Albert Goldbeter, Genevieve Dupont, Michael J.

Using mathematical modeling, we show that mutually inhibitory gradients can generate and position sharp morphogen thresholds in the embryonic space. Taking vertebrate segmentation as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid (RA) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) along the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) may lead to the coexistence of two stable steady states. Here, we propose that this bistability is associated with abrupt switches in the levels of FGF and RA signaling, which permit the synchronized activation of segmentation genes, such as mesp2, in successive cohorts of PSM cells in response to the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Bistability resulting from mutual inhibition of RA and FGF provides a molecular mechanism for the all-or-none transitions assumed in the \"clock and wavefront\" somitogenesis model. Given that mutually antagonistic signaling gradients are common in development, such bistable switches could represent an important principle underlying embryonic patterning.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSharp developmental thresholds defined through bistability by antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid and FGF signaling.

The model simulates components of the HPA axis involved in the continuous secretion and elimination of cortisol, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The physiological relations of these component pieces were modeled based on the current knowledge of their functioning. Rate constants, half lives, and receptor affinities were assigned values derived from the experimental literature. At its current level of development the model is able to accurately simulate the timing, magnitude and decay of the ACTH and cortisol concentration peaks resulting from the ovine-CRH stimulation test in normal and hypercortisolemic patients. The model will be used to predict the effects of lesions in different components of the HPA axis on the time course of cortisol and ACTH levels. We plan to use the model to explore the experimental conditions required to distinguish mechanisms underlying various disorders of the HPA axis, particularly depression.

It is imported by smaller CellML models which describe different voltage protocols, and does not run as a standalone model. The units are consistent throughout. \n \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We have developed a detailed mathematical model for Ca handling and ionic currents in the human ventricular myocyte. Our aims were to: (1) simulate basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; (2) use realistic repolarizing K current densities; (3) reach steady-state. The model relies on the framework of the rabbit myocyte model previously developed by our group, with subsarcolemmal and junctional compartments where ion channels sense higher [Ca] vs. bulk cytosol. Ion channels and transporters have been modeled on the basis of the most recent experimental data from human ventricular myocytes. Rapidly and slowly inactivating components of I(to) have been formulated to differentiate between endocardial and epicardial myocytes. Transmural gradients of Ca handling proteins and Na pump were also simulated. The model has been validated against a wide set of experimental data including action potential duration (APD) adaptation and restitution, frequency-dependent increase in Ca transient peak and [Na](i). Interestingly, Na accumulation at fast heart rate is a major determinant of APD shortening, via outward shifts in Na pump and Na-Ca exchange currents. We investigated the effects of blocking K currents on APD and repolarization reserve: I(Ks) block does not affect the former and slightly reduces the latter; I(K1) blockade modestly increases APD and more strongly reduces repolarization reserve; I(Kr) blockers significantly prolong APD, an effect exacerbated as pacing frequency is decreased, in good agreement with experimental results in human myocytes. We conclude that this model provides a useful framework to explore excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms and repolarization abnormalities at the single myocyte level.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA novel computational model of the human ventricular action potential and Ca transient, Eleonora Grandi, Francesco S.

This model is simulates the administration of L-dopa only, without benserazide added. This model was created using the paper equations supplemented by suggestions made by Dr. Holford, as the original code was not available. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nPURPOSE: To study the PK interaction of L-dopa/benserazide in rats. METHODS: Male rats received a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg L-dopa or 20 mg/kg benserazide or 80/20 mg/kg L-dopa/benserazide. Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes. In the model Ro 04-5127 inhibited competitively the L-dopa clearance by AADC. RESULTS: The coadministration of L-dopa/benserazide resulted in a major increase in systemic exposure to L-dopa and 3-OMD and a decrease in L-dopa clearance. The compartmental model allowed an adequate description of the observed L-dopa and 3-OMD concentrations in the absence and presence of benserazide. It had an advantage over noncompartmental analysis because it could describe the temporal change of inhibition and recovery of AADC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first investigation where the kinetics of benserazide and Ro 04-5127 have been described by a compartmental model. The L-dopa/benserazide model allowed a mechanism-based view of the L-dopa/benserazide interaction and supports the hypothesis that Ro 04-5127 is the primary active metabolite of benserazide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA pharmacokinetic model to predict the PK interaction of L-dopa and benserazide in rats, Susan Grange, Nicholas H.

Most believe that this is due to the drug's ability to act as an efficient blockade of the *de novo* infection of target cells. However, HAART is not 100 percent effective, usually because some long-lived infected cells persist, which then convert to short-lived HIV producers when activated. The extent to which virus production from infected to uninfected cells is blocked is of great importance. The answer will help to determine whether or not HAART is capable of eradicating HIV infection.\n\n\n\n\nThe concept that drug treatment is an efficient blockade of viral replication has derived much of its credibility from being incorporated into a model that successfully fits the kinetic data. This model of HIV dynamics was published by [Perelson *et al.* in 1996](http://www.cellml.org/models/perelson_neumann_markowitz_leonard_ho_1996_version01). Their main observation was that viral load decline following drug application occurred in two discrete phases: an initial rapid decline (phase I) followed by a more gradual decline (phase II). They explained this observation by the fact that the drugs decreased viral load by inhibiting the *de novo* infection of susceptible cells. Phase I reflected the decline of the originally infected cells, and phase II reflected the decline of those infected cells which had a slightly longer half-life.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the authors of the current model, Grossman *et al.* argue that the idea of a cell having a half-life is biologically implausible. They suggest instead that it is more plausible to think of the infected lymphocytes undergoing an aging-like process. That is, the death of an infected, HIV-producing cell follows productive infection after a time delay (see \n the figure\n below). The observed exponential decline in viral load then requires an alternative explanation. This is provided by assuming that *de novo* infection is not blocked completely by HAART, but only reduced. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[HIV infection: how effective is drug combination treatment?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHW-3V5VD9Y-C&_user=140507&_coverDate=11%2F01%2F1998&_alid=132243356&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6077&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=bd6c63528fd70efcdefe0d2be162ea9f), Zvi Grossman, Mark Feinberg, Vladimir Kuznetsov, Dimiter Dimitrov, and William Paul, 1998, [*Immunology Today*](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=JournalURL&_cdi=6077&_auth=y&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=97e17db3f48862ce8ba63183f14ecd55), 19, 528-532.

These stages may represent real stages in the infection process, or they may be regarded as a modelling convenience.

This CellML model runs in both COR and OpenCell. The units have been checked and they are consistent. The equations are based on the scaled set in the paper (9-12) and the concentrations of the hormones are therefore dimensionless. For this reason the CellML model doesn't quite recreate the graphs in figure 4 (where the hormones are assigned units of picomolar and nanomolar).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The body's primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. RESULTS: We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states (low and high) and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this model, low GR concentration represents the normal steady state, and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. Long, repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state cortisol, which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an alternative, low cortisol state. This model can be used to explore mechanisms underlying disorders of the HPA axis.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInclusion of the glucocorticoid receptor in a hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis model reveals bistability, Shakti Gupta, Eric Aslakson, Brian M.

External stress triggers CRH secretion by the hypothalamus. In turn, this signals to the pituitary to release ACTH which stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol. Cortisol binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (R) in the pituitary and has a negative feedback effect on the release of CRH and ACTH. In addition, the cortisol-receptor complex has a positive feedback effect, promoting further receptor synthesis. |\n\n\n\n",

The CellML code in these modules is based on the \nC code from the programme C-MODSIM created by Dr Jean-Pierre Montani.\n\n\n\n\nThis particular CellML model describes the autonomic control of the circulation, which primarily operates through \nthe sympathetic system, though also to a slight extent through parasympathetic signals to the heart. These have been \nlumped together, and there are basically three separate feedback mechanisms in this computational block. \nThese are: (1) feedback from the baroreceptor control system; (2) feedback from the peripheral chemoreceptors in \nthe carotid and aortic bodies,; and (3) feedback control of the circulatory system caused by central nervous system \nischemia, that is, ischemia of the vasomotor center of the brainstem. Several other inputs that affect the autonomic \nnervous system are also included. These are: activation of the autonomic nervous system during exercise; baroreceptor \nfeedback effects from pulmonary artery pressure (PPA), left atrial pressure (PLA), and an effect of low blood PO2 (PO2ART).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation. |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.

These models can be browsed via the *Navigation* panel in the right hand column.\n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) has been developed, consisting of a-intercalated cells and a paracellular pathway, and which includes Na, K, Cl, HCO3, CO2, H2CO3, phosphate, ammonia, and urea. Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is mediated by both H-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H-ATPase, flux through the H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway. Peritubular HCO3 exit is via a conductive pathway and via the Cl/HCO3 exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees celcius in red blood cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996; Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1 or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant, including delivered HCO3 and HPO4, as well as peritubular NH3. Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total proton secretion by this tubule segment.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n\n\nA mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct of the rat, A.M.

The transporter consists of two components: a transmembrane channel and an intracellular catalytic unit. Between these two components there is a buffer space known as the antechamber, in which hydrogen ions (Ha) are in equilibrium with extracellular hydrogen ions (H) due to a large conductance of the transmembrane channel. Hydrogen ions are also moved between the antechamber and the cytosol via the catalytic unit. This ion transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis/synthesis.\n\n\n\n![](chang_2001d.png)\n\nState diagram of the catalytic unit of the H-ATPase. The catalytic unit (E) has two binding sites for H.

The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges (\"latch bridges\"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCross-bridge phosphorylation and regulation of latch state in smooth muscle, Hai CM, Murphy RA, 1988, *American Journal of Physiology*, 254, C99-C106.

Currently CellML cannot be used to describe stochastic variables. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Human scalp hair consists of a set of about 10 to the 5 follicles which progress independently through developmental cycles. Each hair follicle successively goes through the anagen (A), catagen (C), telogen (T) and latency (L) phases that correspond, respectively, to growth, arrest and hair shedding before a new anagen phase is initiated. Long-term experimental observations in a group of ten male, alopecic and non-alopecic volunteers allowed determination of the characteristics of hair follicle cycles. On the basis of these observations, we previously proposed a follicular automaton model to simulate the dynamics of human hair cycles and the development of different patterns of alopecia [Halloy et al. (2000) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A.97, 8328-8333]. The automaton model is defined by a set of rules that govern the stochastic transitions of each follicle between the successive states A, T, L and the subsequent return to A. These transitions occur independently for each follicle, after time intervals given stochastically by a distribution characterized by a mean and a standard deviation. The follicular automaton model was shown to account both for the dynamical transitions observed in a single follicle, and for the behaviour of an ensemble of independently cycling follicles. Here, we extend these results and investigate additional properties of the model. We present a deterministic version of the follicular automaton. We show that numerical simulations of the stochastic version of the automaton yield steady-state level of follicles in the different phases which approach the levels predicted by the deterministic equations as the number of follicles progressively increases. Only the stochastic version can successfully reproduce the fluctuations of the fractions of follicles in each of the three phases, observed in small follicle populations. When the standard deviation is reduced or when the follicles become otherwise synchronized, e.g. by a periodic external signal inducing the transition of anagen follicles into telogen phase, large-amplitude oscillations occur in the fractions of follicles in the three phases. These oscillations are not observed in humans but are reminiscent of the phenomenon of moulting observed in a number of mammalian species.

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA computational model on the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways in heregulin-induced ErbB signalling, Mariko Hatakeyama, Shuhei Kimura, Takashi Naka, Takuji Kawasaki, Noriko Yumoto, Mio Ichikawa, Jae-Hoon Kim, Kazuki Saito, Mihoro Saeki, Mikako Shirouzu, Shigeyuki Yokoyama, and Akihiko Konagaya, 2003, *The Biochemical Journal*, 373, 451-463.

Structurally and functionally, the interactions of hGH with its receptor have been resolved in fine detail, such that hGH and hGH receptor variants can be practically engineered by either random or rational approaches to achieve significant changes in the free energies of binding. A somewhat unique feature of hGH action is its homodimerization of two hGH receptors, which is required for intracellular signaling and stimulation of cell proliferation, yet the potencies of hGH mutants in cell-based assays rarely correlate with their overall receptor-binding avidities. Here, a mathematical model of hGH-stimulated cell signaling is posed, accounting not only for binding interactions at the cell surface but induction of receptor endocytosis and downregulation as well. Receptor internalization affects ligand potency by imposing a limit on the lifetime of an active receptor complex, irrespective of ligand-receptor binding properties.

Site 1 always binds to the receptor first to form a 1:1 ligand-receptor complex (C). A 1:2 dimer (D) may then form through the binding of a second receptor to site 2 of the ligand. Dimer dissociation can occur the uncoupling of either hGH site 1 or site 2, but the 1:1 ligand-receptor complexes bound through site 2 dissociate much faster than those bound through site 1. Dimerised complexes (D) are internalised at a higher rate than are free receptors (R) or 1:1 complexes (C), and while internalised dimers are always degraded, internalised 1:1 complexes or free receptors can either be degraded or recycled to the cell surface.

The model includes two different possible mechanisms to account for the observed disruption of the GnRH-LH relationship in the presence of continuous GnRH exposure: 1) a desensitised receptor, and 2) a limited, yet replenishable, pool of releasable LH. The CellML model runs in COR and OpenCell to replicate the published results. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We model the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the ovine pituitary. GnRH, released by the hypothalamus, stimulates the secretion of LH from the pituitary. If stimulus pulses are regular, LH response will follow a similar pattern. However, during application of GnRH at high frequencies or concentrations or with continuous application, the pituitary delivers a decreased release of LH (termed desensitization). The proposed mathematical model consists of a system of nonlinear differential equations and incorporates two possible mechanisms to account for this observed behavior: desensitized receptor and limited, available LH. Desensitization was provoked experimentally in vitro by using ovine pituitary cells in a perifusion system. The model was fit to resulting experimental data by using maximum-likelihood estimation. Consideration of smaller models revealed that the desensitized receptor is significant. Limited, available LH was significant in three of four chambers. Throughout, the proposed model was in excellent agreement with experimental data.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the components and reactions involved in the first model of luteinizing hormone (LH) release. kfb, kdf, and kbd are kinetic constants, F, B, and D represent the free, bound, and desensitised states of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, while R represents releasable LH and B is bound LH. s is the rate of the reaction, a1 determines the rate of basal LH secretion and a2 is the rate of LH secretion in the presence of bound receptor. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical model of luteinizing hormone release from ovine pituitary cells in perifusion, K.

The model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes.

Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data.

Treatment of HIV-1 with protease inhibitors results in the decline of free virus in several distinct phases: Initially the plasma virus load remains virtually unchanged, then after this initial delay, the plasma load declines exponentially, due to the decreased virus synthesis in infected cells, and also due to the clearance of free virus particles. Finally, the rate of virus decline decreases, and the viral load may even begin to increase again as the virus evolves a resistance to the protease inhibitor.\n\n\n\n\nThis publication by Herz *et al.* quickly followed an article by [Perelson *et al.* (1996)](http://www.cellml.org/models/perelson_neumann_markowitz_leonard_ho_1996_version01) in which they developed a mathematical model of HIV-1 dynamics *in vivo* based on their experimental data. In this current publication, Herz *et al.* develop a new model that provides a description of HIV-1 dynamics, including the effects of an intracellular delay (the period between infection of a cell and the production of new virus particles).

The approach has been to use the simplest possible formulations of these mechanisms, which together with a minimum number of additional mechanisms allow reconstruction of action potentials, intracellular calcium transients and extracellular calcium transients. A 3:1 sodium-calcium exchange stoichiometry is assumed. Calcium-channel inactivation is assumed to take place by a voltage-dependent mechanism, which is accelerated by a rise in intracellular calcium; intracellular calcium release becomes a major physiological regulator of calcium influx via calcium channels. A calcium release mechanism is assumed, which is both calcium- and voltage-sensitive, and which undergoes prolonged inactivation. 200 microM cytosolic calcium buffer is assumed. For most simulations only instantaneous potassium conductances are simulated so as to study the other mechanisms independently of time- and calcium-dependent outward current. Thus, the model reconstructs extracellular calcium transients and typical action-potential configuration changes during steady-state and non-steady-state stimulation from the mechanisms directly involved in trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements. The model predicts relatively small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation (ca. 2 mumol kg-1 fresh mass per excitation); calcium current is fully activated within 2 ms of excitation, inactivation is substantially complete within 30 ms, and sodium-calcium exchange significantly resists repolarization from approximately -30 mV. Net calcium movements many times larger are possible during non-steady-state stimulation. Long action potentials at premature excitations or after inhibition of calcium release can be supported almost exclusively by calcium current (net calcium influx 5-30 mumol kg-1 fresh mass); action potentials during potentiated post-stimulatory contractions can be supported almost exclusively by sodium-calcium exchange (net calcium efflux 4-20 mumol kg-1 fresh mass). Large calcium movements between the extracellular space and the sarcoplasmic reticulum can take place through the cytosol with virtually no contractile activation. The simulations provide integrated explanations of electrical activity, contractile function and trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements, which were outside the explanatory range of previous models.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nExcitation-contraction coupling and extracellular calcium transients in rabbit atrium: reconstruction of the basic cellular mechanisms, Hilemann, D.W. and Noble, D. 1987,*Proc.

The resulting model, referred to as the coupled LCC-RyR gating model, successfully reproduces a range of experimental data, including L-Type Ca2+ current in response to voltage-clamp stimuli, inactivation of LCC current with and without Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, voltage-dependence of excitation-contraction coupling gain, graded release, and the force-frequency relationship.

Add [membrane current component](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/components/clamped_current.cellml/view), [voltage clamp](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/experiments/voltage_clamp_protocol.cellml) and [voltage clamp experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/experiments/voltage_clamp_experiment.cellml/view) to simulate a membrane current during a voltage clamp.\n3. Add [gate initialization components](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/components/gate_initials.cellml/view) to enable the simulation of anode break excitation.\n4. Add [propagated action potential model](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/components/propagated_AP.cellml/view) and [action potential propagation experiment](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/experiments/AP_propagation_experiment.cellml) to simulate a propagated action potential (please see [Known issues](#known-issues)).\n5. Add the python scripts to run simulation and reproduce the figures in the original paper.\n\n\n\n\n### Known issues\n\n\n1. The voltage clamp value cannot be -10 mV as the *\u03b1**n* would be infinity.\n2. The [propagated action potential model](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/672/components/propagated_AP.cellml/view) does not work, which needs further investigation in future.\n3. The temperature unit is set to Kelvin in the CellML models. If you want to simulate the model behavior at temperature T with unit Celsius, you do not need to do conversion as the offset is cancelled in the mathematical expressions including temperature factor.\n4. You need to set appropriate parameters and initial values in the CellML files, if you want to run simulation using [OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/) rather than the provided Python scripts.\n5. The *V* in the model is defined relative to the resting potential, while the inward current is positive. This is different from the convention of modern physiological modelling.\n\n\n\n\n",

In the more traditional genetic engineering approaches 'bottle-necks' are pinpointed using qualitative, intuitive approaches, but the alleviation of suspected 'rate-limiting' steps has not often been successful. Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http://jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself. Experiments confirmed the predictions of the model, i.e. knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and overexpressing NADH oxidase increased the flux through the acetolactate synthase branch from 0 to 75% of measured product formation rates.\n\n\n\n\n Metabolic engineering of lactic acid bacteria, the combined approach: kinetic modelling, metabolic control and experimental analysis, Marcel H.N.

Recently, it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene expression. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nControl of MAPK signalling: from complexity to what really matters, Jorrit J Hornberg, Bernd Binder, Frank J Bruggeman, Birgit Schoeberl, Reinhart Heinrich and Hans V Westerhoff, 2005, *Oncogene*, 26, 117-125.

This model was previously proposed in the course of an investigation of plausible mechanisms capable of generating complex Ca2+ oscillations. Besides simple periodic behavior, this model for cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in nonexcitable cells shows complex oscillatory phenomena like bursting or chaos. We show that the model also admits a coexistence between two stable regimes of sustained oscillations (birhythmicity). The occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior is analysed by means of bifurcation diagrams. Complex oscillations are characterized by means of Poincare sections, power spectra and Lyapounov exponents. The results point to the role of self-modulation of the InsP3 signal by 3-kinase as a possible source for complex temporal patterns in Ca2+ signaling.\n\n\n\n Bursting, Chaos and Birhythmicity Originating from Self-modulation of the Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate Signal in a Model for Intracellular Ca2+ Oscillations, Houart G, Dupont G, Goldbeter A, 1999, *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*\n , 61, 507-530 [PubMed ID: 17883229](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17883229)\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of the model based on the interplay between CICR and the Ca2+-stimulated degradation of InsP3.

Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nUltrasensitivity in the mitogen-activated protein cascade, Chi-Ying F.

A novel theoretical model of the canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca2+ transient (CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca2+-release formulation, Ca2+ subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L)) reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na). CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This positive rate-dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell function.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Hund and Rudy 2004 Canine Ventricular Cell Model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRate dependence and regulation of action potential and calcium transient in a canine cardiac ventricular cell model, Thomas J.

However, responses to receptor activation cannot be easily ascribed to a uniform increase or decrease in cAMP activity throughout the entire cell. In this study, we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) and M(2) muscarinic receptor (M(2)R) activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane (caveolar and extracaveolar) microdomains and one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of beta(1)ARs and M(2)Rs, as well as the location of stimulatory (G(s)) and inhibitory (G(i)) G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited (AC5/6) and stimulated (AC4/7) by G(i), and multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4). Results obtained with the model indicate that: 1), bulk basal cAMP can be high ( approximately 1 microM) and only modestly stimulated by beta(1)AR activation ( approximately 2 microM), but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A ( approximately 100 nM to approximately 2 microM); 2), M(2)R activation strongly reduces the beta(1)AR-induced increases in caveolar cAMP, with less effect on bulk cAMP; and 3), during weak beta(1)AR stimulation, M(2)R activation not only reduces caveolar cAMP, but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of M(2)R activity.

However, responses to receptor activation cannot be easily ascribed to a uniform increase or decrease in cAMP activity throughout the entire cell. In this study, we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) and M(2) muscarinic receptor (M(2)R) activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane (caveolar and extracaveolar) microdomains and one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of beta(1)ARs and M(2)Rs, as well as the location of stimulatory (G(s)) and inhibitory (G(i)) G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited (AC5/6) and stimulated (AC4/7) by G(i), and multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4). Results obtained with the model indicate that: 1), bulk basal cAMP can be high ( approximately 1 microM) and only modestly stimulated by beta(1)AR activation ( approximately 2 microM), but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A ( approximately 100 nM to approximately 2 microM); 2), M(2)R activation strongly reduces the beta(1)AR-induced increases in caveolar cAMP, with less effect on bulk cAMP; and 3), during weak beta(1)AR stimulation, M(2)R activation not only reduces caveolar cAMP, but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of M(2)R activity. We conclude that compartmentation of cAMP can provide a quantitative explanation for several aspects of cardiac signaling.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCompartmentation of cAMP signaling in cardiac myocytes: a computational study, Radu V.

This is achieved by mutation of the genes encoding the antibody, followed by selection for the B cells which express B cell receptors with the highest affinity for antigen. Both gene mutation and subsequent protein selection occur in the germinal centres of secondary lymphoid organs. Upon immunisation (infection), the antigen is concentrated in the secondary lymphoid organs, where a small subset of all B cells recognise it. After successful presentation of the antigen fragments to T cells, B cells enter the blast state. After about three days, the B blasts differentiate into centroblasts, and then into centrocytes. Centrocytes express B cell receptors on their surface and they are believed to be subject to selection by antigen in that they need to bind, internalise and present antigen to T cells in order to prevent their under going apoptosis. Centrocytes that successfully interact with T cells (selected centrocytes), can either differentiate into memory cells, antibody forming cells (AFCs), or they can revert back to the centroblast state (see \n the figure\n below). \n\n\n\n\nShortly after the first differentiation of centroblasts into centrocytes, somatic hypermutation starts to act on the centroblasts and changes the affinity of the B cell receptors for the antigen. About 53% of the mutations are silent, and have no affect on affinity. About 28% of the mutations are fatal, leading to B cell apoptosis. The remaining 19% of mutations either increase or decrease affinity. Selection is therefore needed to select for the mutations leading to an increase in affinity and driving affinity maturation. \n\n\n\n\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not yet clearly understood, and as yet there is no experimental system available to investigate this. A mathematical model is therefore useful in investigating hypotheses and comparing their simulation results with available experimental data. In 2002, Iber and Maini published a mathematical model for germinal centre kinetics and affinity maturation. They began with a simple model of the primed primary immune response (see \n the figure\n below), and then in this they embedded the model of affinity maturation. Model simulations showed that antigen masking by antibodies can drive affinity maturation and provide a stabilising feedback mechanism. Iber and Maini proposed that the selection probability of centrocytes and the recycling probability of selected centrocytes vary over time. They also show that the efficiency of affinity maturation is highest if clones with a very high affinity antigen leave the germinal centre for either the memory or the plasma cell pool. It is further shown that the termination of somatic hypermutation for several days before the end of the germinal centre immune reaction is beneficial for affinity maturation. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[A Mathematical Model for Germinal Centre Kinetics and Affinity Maturation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMD-473FKFB-2&_user=140507&_coverDate=11%2F21%2F2002&_alid=68493445&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6932&_sort=d&_docanchor=&wchp=dGLbVzb-lSztW&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=2fc7f8fdccbb3c62ea86d7cb8904dd8a), Dagmar Iber and Philip K.

A model for the dynamics of oxidative stress was proposed to predict the time course of the qualitative concentrations of H2 O2 and the superoxide radical (O2 \u2022 \u2212 ) in different oxygen cultures. The 20% and 30% O2 cultures exhibited similar differentiated hepatic functions that were unequivocally lost in the 40% O2 cultures apparently due to oxidative damage.

Although action potential models have been developed for most regions of the heart, there is no model for the atrioventricular node (AVN). We have developed action potential models for single atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-His cells. The models have the same action potential shapes and refractoriness as observed in experiments. Using these models, together with models for the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrial muscle, we have developed a one-dimensional (1D) multicellular model including the SAN and AVN. The multicellular model has slow and fast pathways into the AVN and using it we have analyzed the rich behavior of the AVN. Under normal conditions, action potentials were initiated in the SAN center and then propagated through the atrium and AVN. The relationship between the AVN conduction time and the timing of a premature stimulus (conduction curve) is consistent with experimental data. After premature stimulation, atrioventricular nodal reentry could occur. After slow pathway ablation or block of the L-type Ca(2+) current, atrioventricular nodal reentry was abolished. During atrial fibrillation, the AVN limited the number of action potentials transmitted to the ventricle. In the absence of SAN pacemaking, the inferior nodal extension acted as the pacemaker. In conclusion, we have developed what we believe is the first detailed mathematical model of the AVN and it shows the typical physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the tissue. The model can be used as a tool to analyze the complex structure and behavior of the AVN.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Inada et al. 2009 cell model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nOne-dimensional mathematical model of the atrioventricular node including atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-his cells, S.

We have developed a mathematical model of a single cardiomyocyte to integrate various I-F relations, including alternans, by incorporating a conceptual CaMKII kinetics model into the SR Ca2+ handling model. Our model integrates I-F relations, such as the beat interval-dependent twitch force duration, restitution and potentiation, positive staircase phenomenon and alternans. We found that CaMKII affects more or less all I-F relations, and it is a key factor for integration of the various I-F relations in our model. Alternans arises, in the model, out of a steep relation between SR Ca2+ load and release, owing to SR load-dependent changes in the releasability of Ca2+ via the ryanodine receptor. Beat interval-dependent CaMKII activity, owing to its kinetic properties and amplifying effect on SR Ca2+ load dependency of Ca2+ release, replicated the beat interval dependency of alternans, as observed experimentally. Additionally, our model enabled reproduction of the effects of various interventions on alternans, such as the slowing or accelerating of Ca2+ release and/or uptake. We conclude that a slow time-dependent factor, represented in the model by CaMKII, is important for the integration of I-F relations, including alternans, and that our model offers a useful tool for further analysis of the roles of integrative Ca2+ handling in myocardial I-F relations.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModulatory effect of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling and interval-force relations: a modelling study, Gentaro Iribe, Peter Kohl and Denis Noble, 2006, \n *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A*, 364, (1842), 1107-1133.

In this study, we simulated mutations in 2 genes\nlinked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, the first located in calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the\nsecond in the ryanodine receptor (RyR2).

Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) luminal\nCa2 sensing was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular myocyte, and CSQN2 mutations were modeled\nby simulating disrupted RyR2 luminal Ca2 sensing. In voltage-clamp mode, the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated\nthe smaller calcium transients, smaller time to peak calcium transient, and accelerated recovery from inactivation seen\nin experiments. In current clamp mode, in the presence of stimulation, we observed delayed afterdepolarizations,\nsuggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2 sensing underlies the triggered activity\nobserved in mutant CSQN2-expressing myocytes. In current-clamp mode, in a model of mutant RyR2 that is\ncharacterized by reduced FKBP12.6 binding to the RyR2 on stimulation, the impaired coupled gating characteristic\nof these mutations was modeled by reducing cooperativity of RyR2 activation.

A new model for the gating of the slow component of the delayed rectifier current is formulated and validated against experimental data. Properties of calcium handling and exchanger currents are altered to appropriately represent the dynamics of intracellular ion concentrations. The model is able to both reproduce and predict a wide range of behaviors observed experimentally including action potential morphology, ionic currents, intracellular calcium transients, frequency dependence of action-potential duration, Ca(2+)-frequency relations, and extrasystolic restitution/post-extrasystolic potentiation.

Cooperativity of the first type is due to the dependence of the affinity of troponin C for Ca2+ on the concentration of myosin crossbridges in the vicinity of a given troponin C.

We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading.

The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n \nABSTRACT: We construct a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ regulation in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Cardiac Calcium Dynamics: The Roles of Ryanodine Receptor Adaptation and Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Load, M.

It involves both the central and the enteric nervous systems (CNS and ENS respectively), in addition to a network of paracrine and endocrine cells. The overall aim is to maintain stomach luminal pH within a narrow range such that food digestion is optimised. \n\n\n\n\nFour cell populations and their secretory products form the core acid secretory process in humans. These four cell populations are gastrin (G)- and somatostatin (D)-secreting cells, endochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and parietal cells. G and ECL cell products stimulate acid secretion (positive feedback) and D cells inhibit acid release (negative feedback). Exactly how these feedback loops interact is species specific, however, the basic requirement for acid secretion is conserved amongst species. Mathematical modelling provides a powerful tool for investigating the integrated system, and it is also immune to the inconsistencies of *in vivo* and *in vitro* experimental studies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Joseph *et al.* 2003 publication described here, the authors use a novel mathematical model to describe the complex system of gastric acid regulation (see and below). They use experimental data to validate their model simulations, and then go onto use the model to study conditions that are not yet experimentally reproducible.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[A model for integrative study of human gastric acid secretion](http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/94/4/1602), Ian M.P.

The modified model allowed us to simulate and explain some subtle experimental data on relaxation velocity in isotonic twitches and on a mismatch between the time course of sarcomere shortening/lengthening and the time course of active force generation in isometric twitches. Model results were compared with experimental data obtained from 28 rat LV papillary muscles contracting and relaxing against various loads.

In his 2001 paper (cited below), James Keener examines a mathematical model for *in vitro* insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in a one-dimensional chemical flow reactor, where the reaction region is represented by the volume occupied by the cells (see \n the figure\n below). Glucose enters the cell through GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 transporters.

In the extracellular medium, insulin activates GLUT-1 transporters and inactivates GLUT-2 transporters. \n\n\n\n\nIn order to model the reactions, a steady flow of solution along the one-dimensional reactor is assumed, with insulin cells confined to a one-dimensional region.

Adaptation occurs during the slow, spontaneous decrease in the open probability of a channel after it has been rapidly activated by a pulse of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i). RyR activation occurs within milliseconds, whereas inactivation occurs on a timescale of a few seconds. The RyR is said to have \"adapted\" during inactivation because a subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i produces a nearly identical rise in the open probability.\n\n\n\n\nIn their 1996 paper, Joel Keizer and Leslie Levine develop a simplified model that mimics the \"adaptation\" of the RyR, and they investigate its significance for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+ oscillations in cardiac cells. The mechanism used to mimic adaptation of the RyR is shown schematically in \n the figure\n below. States C1 and C2 are closed states and O1 and O2 are open states. Transitions from C1 to O1 and from O1 to O2 are assumed to be Ca2+-dependent. These steps correspond to the phenomenon of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). To analyse the mechanism in \n the figure\n , Keizer and Levine translated the schematic diagram into kinetic equations. In addition, they test these equations in a closed-cell kinetic model, and they find that RyR adaptation can cause Ca2+ oscillations.

Earlier models for GC kinetics are extended by explicitly modeling 1) the cell division history of centroblasts, 2) the Ag uptake by centrocytes, and 3) T cell dynamics. Allowing for T cell kinetics and T-B cell interactions, we study the role of GC T cells in GC kinetics, GC termination, and B cell selection. We find that GC T cells play a major role in GC formation, but that the maintenance of established GC reactions requires very few T cells only. The results therefore suggest that the termination of a GC reaction is largely caused by lack of Ag on the follicular dendritic cells and is hardly influenced by Th cells. Ag consumption by centrocytes is the major factor determining the decay rate of the antigenic stimulus during a GC reaction. Investigating the effect of the Ag dose on GC kinetics, we find that both the total size of the GC and its duration are hardly influenced by the initial amount of Ag. In the model this is due to a buffering effect by competition for limited T cell help and/or competition between proliferating centroblasts. \n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Mathematical Model on Germinal Center Kinetics and Termination, Can Kesmir and Rob J.

These models include equations that describe transmembrane ion channels and pumps, as well as the intracellular calcium uptake and release activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and changing intracellular ionic concentrations. Dynamic models are carefully constructed to accurately simulate the experimentally observed electrophysiological behaviour of cells.\n\n\n\n\nTime-dependent changes (transients) in ionic concentrations and action potentials are often observed in experiments. In mathematical models, transients may represent artifacts of the equations or may reflect physiological processes. In their 2002 paper, James Kneller, Rafael J. Ramirez, Denis Charter, Marc Courtemanche and Stanley Nattel studied electrophysiological transients in an ionic model of the canine atrial action potential. Their aims were to determine whether dynamic models reach stability during sustained pacing, to investigate the ionic basis of action potential transients in the model, and to compare real physiological action potential transients with those generated by the model. Their model was based on the previously published Ramirez-Nattel-Courtemanche (RNC) model of the canine action potential (see Ramirez *et al.* Canine Atrial Action Potential Model, 2000, also in the CellML model repository). In this model, *I*\nCl,Ca brings Cl- into the cell, but there is no equation to account for Cl- efflux. In their 2002 modified version of the RNC model, James Kneller, Rafael J. Ramirez, Denis Charter, Marc Courtemanche and Stanley Nattel include an inward, electroneutral Na+-Cl- cotransporter (*I*\nNa,Ca), and a constant Cl- efflux through a leakage pathway (*I*\nb,Cl) (see the figure below).\n\n\n\n\nAfter comparing the results simulated by the model with experimental data, James Kneller, Rafael J. Ramirez, Denis Chartier, Marc Courtemanche and Stanley Nattel conclude that model action potential duration and ionic transients stabilise with appropriate stimulus current assignment. They also found that their model agrees qualitatively with experimental observations, but quantitative discrepancies highlight limitations of model simulations.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Time-dependent transients in an ionically based mathematical model of the canine atrial action potential](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/282/4/H1437) James Kneller, Rafael J.

A prime example of such an intricate cell is the cardiac myocyte. For the predictive power of the cardiomyocyte models, it is vital to accurately describe the calcium transport mechanisms, since they essentially link the electrical activation to contractility. The removal of calcium from the cytoplasm takes place mainly by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). In the present study, we review the properties of SERCA, its frequency-dependent and beta-adrenergic regulation, and the approaches of mathematical modelling that have been used to investigate its function. Furthermore, we present novel theoretical considerations that might prove useful for the elucidation of the role of SERCA in cardiac function, achieving a reduction in model complexity, but at the same time retaining the central aspects of its function. Our results indicate that to faithfully predict the physiological properties of SERCA, we should take into account the calcium-buffering effect and reversible function of the pump. This 'uncomplicated' modelling approach could be useful to other similar transport mechanisms as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of SERCA pump. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium APTase and its Regulation in Cardiac Myocytes, Jussi T.

PTH targets bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, to increase expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Intriguingly, whereas continuous administration of PTH decreases bone mass, intermittent PTH has an anabolic effect on bone, which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on osteoblastic bone formation. However, antiresorptive therapies impair the ability of PTH to increase bone mass, indicating a complex role for osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes the actions of PTH at a single site of bone remodeling, where osteoclasts and osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts. As a result, PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon application, followed by compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration resulted in net bone loss, because bone resorption preceded bone formation at all times. In contrast, over a wide range of model parameters, short application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone mass, because osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH withdrawal, enabling osteoblasts to rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental findings, increase in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone. This study presents an original concept for the regulation of bone remodeling by PTH, currently the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of the interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts included in the model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model of paracrine interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts predicts anabolic action of parathyroid hormone on bone, Komarova SV, 2005, *Endocrinology*, 146, 3589-3595.

Disruptions in bone remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and Paget's disease. Interactions among cells of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages are critical in the regulation of bone remodeling. We constructed a mathematical model of autocrine and paracrine interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts that allowed us to calculate cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. The model predicted different modes of dynamic behavior: a single remodeling cycle in response to an external stimulus, a series of internally regulated cycles of bone remodeling, or unstable behavior similar to pathological bone remodeling in Paget's disease. Parametric analysis demonstrated that the mode of dynamic behavior in the system depends strongly on the regulation of osteoclasts by autocrine factors, such as transforming growth factor beta. Moreover, simulations demonstrated that nonlinear dynamics of the system may explain the differing effects of immunosuppressants on bone remodeling in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the mathematical model revealed that interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts result in complex, nonlinear system behavior, which cannot be deduced from studies of each cell type alone. The model will be useful in future studies assessing the impact of cytokines, growth factors, and potential therapies on the overall process of remodeling in normal bone and in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts included in the model.

However, the selective forces responsible for the emergence of genetic instability are not clear. We use mathematical models to determine the conditions under which selection favors instability, and when stable cells are advantageous. We take into account the processes of DNA damage, repair, cell cycle arrest, mutation, and death. We find that the rate of DNA damage can play a major role in this context. In particular, an increase in the rate of DNA damage can reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells. In terms of cancer progression, we find the following results. If cells have intact apoptotic responses, stable cells prevail if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can result in the selection of genetically unstable cells. This has implications for the induction of tumors by carcinogens. On the other hand, if cells are characterized by impaired apoptosis, we observe the opposite. Genetic instability is selected for if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can select against instability and result in the persistence of stable cells. We propose that chemotherapy can be used to reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells, such that unstable cells are the inferior competitors. This could result in the competitive exclusion of progressing cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEvolutionary dynamics of mutator phenotypes in cancer: implications for chemotherapy, Natalia L.

TempCDv and TempCDa define the variable elastances of the cardiac chambers together with the heart valve dynamics. EAtrium and EVentricle define the activation functions, which are used in the calculation of these variable elastances. In addition to the templates, a further component, \u2018Units\u2019, is defined. This provides the definitions of the derived units of the variables of pressure, flow-rate, volume, vessel resistance, blood inertia, vessel elasticity etc. in the model. The parameter settings for the model are specified in three separate components; ParaHeart, ParaSys and ParaPul, which contain the respective values for the system variables. The templates are then imported into the upper-level description of the model, in which each template-type is integrated with the unit definitions and specific parameter settings appropriate for the vessel segment or cardiac chamber described. Upper level component models for the systemic loop, the pulmonary loop and the heart are then constructed using the group feature to assemble the individual vessel segments or cardiac chambers into the general function modules. Finally the functional modules of heart, systemic loop and pulmonary loop are connected to form the complete CellML model.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original model was presented in the following papers:\n\n\n\n\nA concentrated parameter model for the human cardiovascular system including heart valve dynamics and atrioventricular interaction, Korakianitis T., Shi Y., 2006. *Medical Engineering and Physics* 28, 613-28, [PubMed ID: 16293439](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293439).\n\n\n\nNumerical simulation of cardiovascular dynamics with healthy and diseased heart valves, Korakianitis T., Shi Y., 2006. *Journal of Biomechanics* 39 (11), 1964-82, [PubMed ID: 16140309](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16140309).\n\n\n\nNumerical simulation of cardiovascular dynamics with left heart failure and in-series pulsatile ventricular assist device, Shi Y., Korakianitis T., 2006. *Artificial Organs* 30 (12), 929-48, [PubMed ID: 17181834](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17181834).\n\n\n\n\n",

PTH is pulsed every 6 hours and the model needs to be run for some time before the oscillations stabilise. The CellML model will also run in COR but due to the time unit being hours it is not really suitable for full length simulations.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) paradoxically causes net bone loss (resorption) when administered in a continuous fashion, and net bone formation (deposition) when administered intermittently. Currently no pharmacological formulations are available to promote bone formation, as needed for the treatment of osteoporosis. The paradoxical behavior of PTH confuses endocrinologists, thus, a model bone resorption or deposition dependent on the timing of PTH administration would de-mystify this behavior and provide the basis for logical drug formulation. We developed a mathematical model that accounts for net bone loss with continuous PTH administration and net bone formation with intermittent PTH administration, based on the differential effects of PTH on the osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations of cells. Bone, being a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of PTH. The overall effect of PTH is to raise plasma levels of calcium, partly through bone resorption. Osteoclasts resorb bone and liberate calcium, but they lack receptors for PTH. The preosteoblastic precursors and preosteoblasts possess receptors for PTH, upon which the hormone induces differentiation from the precursor to preosteoblast and from the preosteoblast to the osteoblast. The osteoblasts generate IL-6; IL-6 stimulates preosteoclasts to differentiate into osteoclasts. We developed a mathematical model for the differentiation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations in bone, using a delay time of 1 hour for differentiation of preosteoblastic precursors into preosteoblasts and 2 hours for the differentiation of preosteoblasts into osteoblasts. The ratio of the number of osteoblasts to osteoclasts indicates the net effect of PTH on bone resorption and deposition; the timing of events producing the maximum ratio would induce net bone deposition. When PTH is pulsed with a frequency of every hour, the preosteoblastic population rises and decreases in nearly a symmetric pattern, with 3.9 peaks every 24 hours, and 4.0 peaks every 24 hours when PTH is administered every 6 hours. Thus, the preosteoblast and osteoblast frequency depends more on the nearly constant value of the PTH, rather than on the frequency of the PTH pulsations. Increasing the time delay gradually increases the mean value for the number of osteoblasts. The osteoblastic population oscillates for all intermittent administrations of PTH and even when the PTH infusion is constant. The maximum ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts occurs when PTH is administered in pulses of every 6 hours. The delay features in the model bear most of the responsibility for the occurrence of these oscillations, because without the delay and in the presence of constant PTH infusions, no oscillations occur. However, with a delay, under constant PTH infusions, the model generates oscillations. The osteoblast oscillations express limit cycle behavior. Phase plane analysis show simple and complex attractors. Subsequent to a disturbance in the number of osteoblasts, the osteoblasts quickly regain their oscillatory behavior and cycle back to the original attractor, typical of limit cycle behavior. Further, because the model was constructed with dissipative and nonlinear features, one would expect ensuing oscillations to show limit cycle behavior. The results from our model, increased bone deposition with intermittent PTH administration and increased bone resorption with constant PTH administration, conforms with experimental observations and with an accepted explanation for osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the effect of PTH on the development of osteoblasts. PTH binds to receptors on the preosteoblast precursors and stimulates their transition to preosteoblasts. However, PTH binding to these preosteoblasts inhibits their differentiation into osteoblasts, and IL-6 (which is secreted by the osteoblasts) is believed to enhance this inhibitory effect. The osteoblasts then differentiate into osteocytes at a rate which is dependent on their number. The IL-6 produced by the osteoblasts also stimulates the differentiation of preosteoclasts to osteoclasts. Osteoclasts become senescent at a rate dependent on their number. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nParathyroid hormone temporal effects on bone formation and resorption, Martin H.

Over the past decade a large body of data on the ionic currents underlying this pacemaker activity has been elucidated in patch-clamp experiments. On the basis of this data, several mathematical models describing the pace maker activity of a single rabbit SA node cell have been developed. These include:\n\n\n* [Demir *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 1994;](http://www.cellml.org/models/demir_clark_giles_murphey_1994_version01)\n* [Modelling the Ion Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity, Dokos *et al.*, 1996;](http://www.cellml.org/models/dokos_celler_lovell_1996_version06)\n* [A Model of Sinoatrial Node Vagal Control, Dokos *et al.*, 1996;](http://www.cellml.org/models/dokos_celler_lovell_1996_version06)\n* [Demir *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 1999;](http://www.cellml.org/models/demir_clark_giles_1999_version03)\n* [Zhang *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 2000; and](http://www.cellml.org/models/zhang_holden_kodama_honjo_lei_varghese_boyett_2000_version03)\n* [Boyett *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 2001.](http://www.cellml.org/models/boyett_zhang_garny_holden_2001_version01)\n\n\n\nWith the elucidation of more experimental data, these models have become increasingly complex, with equations that describe calcium buffering, intracellular compartmentation, and additional ionic currents through channels, pumps and exchangers. In the study by Kurata *et al.* described here, the aim is to develop an improved mathematical model of a single primary pacemaker cell of the rabbit SA node, in order to investigate the mechanisms underlying pacemaker generation. On the basis of the most recent experimental data, Kurata *et al.* updated the previously published models (see list above) in several ways:\n\n\n\n* A sustained inward current has been added (*Ist*).\n* The voltage- and Ca2+-dependent activation kinetics of the L-type calcium channel current (*ICa,L*) have been reformulated.\n* Expressions for the activation kinetics of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (*IKr*) have been updated.\n* Revised kinetic equations for two 4-AP sensitive currents (*Ito* and *Isus*) have been incorporated.\n* Voltage- and concentration-dependent kinetics of the Na+-K+ pump current (*INaK*) have been reformulated.\n* The subsarcolemmal space (see \n the figure\n below) as a diffusion barrier for intracellular Ca2+ has been added.\n\n\n\nThe model was validated by comparing simulation results with experimental data, and also by comparing them with those of previous mathematical models. The authors concluded that their model represented a significant improvement over previous models because it can:\n\n\n* Simulate whole cell voltage-clamp data for *ICa,L*, *IKr*, and *Ist*;\n* Reproduce the wave shapes of spontaneous action potentials and ionic currents during action potential clamp recordings; and\n* Mimic the effects of channel blockers or Ca 2+ buffers on pacemaker activity more accurately than the previous models.\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Dynamical description of sinoatrial node pacemaking: improved mathematical model for primary pacemaker cell](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/283/5/H2074), Yasutaka Kurata, Ichiro Hisatome, Sunao Imanishi, and Toshishige Shibamoto, 2002, [*American Journal of Physiology*](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/), 283, H2074-H2101.

This high degree of robustness allows one, for the first time, to model features of the system such as circadian rhythm and response to hormone injections. In addition, relative to its closest predecessor, the model is simpler; it contains only about half of the parameters, and yet achieves more functions. The new model provides opportunities for teaching endocrinology within a biological or medical school context; it may also have applications in modeling and studying HPA axis disorders, for example, related to gland size dynamics, abnormal hormone levels, or stress influences. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Adding features physiologically relevant to muscle-a fixed glycogen concentration, efflux of lactate, and coupling to an ATPase-allowed for a steady-state flux far from equilibrium. The main result of our analysis is that coupling of the glycogenolytic network to the ATPase transformed the entire complex into an ATPase driven system. This steady-state system was most sensitive to the external ATPase activity and not to internal pathway mechanisms.

The model includes two feedback mechanisms: 1) a positive feedback, or cooperativity, in which the cycling cross bridges affect the affinity of troponin for calcium, and 2) a negative mechanical feedback, where the filament-sliding velocity affects cross-bridge cycling. The model simulates the reported experimental force-length and force-velocity relationships at different levels of activation. The dependence of the shortening velocity on calcium concentration, sarcomere length, internal load, and rate of cross-bridge cycling is described analytically in agreement with reported data. Furthermore, the model provides an analytic solution for Hill's equation of the force-velocity relationship and for the phenomena of unloaded shortening velocity and force deficit.

In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per/Cry/Rev-Erbalpha and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nToward a detailed computational model for the mammalian circadian clock, Jean-Christophe Leloup and Albert Goldbeter, 2003,*PNAS*, 100, 7051-7056.

Also please note that in the version of the model presented here, parameter set 4 from the original paper has been used. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model for circadian oscillations in mammals including positive and negative feedback on the transcription of the Per, Cry and Bmal1 genes by their protein products.

For Drosophila, the molecular model is based on the negative feedback exerted on the expression of the per and tim genes by the complex formed between the PER and TIM proteins. For Neurospora, similarly, the model relies on the feedback exerted on the expression of the frq gene by its protein product FRQ. In both models, sustained rhythmic variations in protein and mRNA levels occur in continuous darkness, in the form of limit cycle oscillations. The effect of light on circadian rhythms is taken into account in the models by considering that it triggers degradation of the TIM protein in Drosophila, and frq transcription in Neurospora. When incorporating the control exerted by light at the molecular level, we show that the models can account for the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light-dark cycles and for the damping of the oscillations in constant light, though such damping occurs more readily in the Drosophila model. The models account for the phase shifts induced by light pulses and allow the construction of phase response curves. These compare well with experimental results obtained in Drosophila. The model for Drosophila shows that when applied at the appropriate phase, light pulses of appropriate duration and magnitude can permanently or transiently suppress circadian rhythmicity. We investigate the effects of the magnitude of light-induced changes on oscillatory behavior. Finally, we discuss the common and distinctive features of circadian oscillations in the two organisms.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nLimit Cycle Models for Circadian Rhythms Based on Transcriptional Regulation in *Drosophila* and *Neurospora*, Jean-Christophe Leloup, Didier Gonze, and Albert Goldbeter, 1999, *Journal of Biological Rhythms*, 14, 433-448.

The model runs in both OpenCell and COR to recreate the published results. The units are consistent throughout.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, two cell types specialized in the maintenance of the bone integrity. Bone is a dynamic, living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the basic structure of the model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast activities in bone remodeling, Vincent Lemaire, Frank L.

A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P(2)Y(2) receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP(2) depletion and resupply on the time course of IP(3) and Ca2+ levels.

It has been suggested that the interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump (Johnson et al. (1992) Science 258, 665-667). We formulate and explore a theoretical model, with a minimal number of currents, for this novel mechanism of burst generation. This minimal model is further developed into a more elaborate model based on observations of additional currents and hypotheses about their spatial distribution in dopaminergic neurons (Hounsgaard (1992) Neuroscience 50, 513-518; Llinas et al. (1984) Brain Res. 294, 127-132). Using the minimal model, we confirm that interaction between the regenerative, inward N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated current and the outward Na(+)-pump current is sufficient to generate the slow oscillation (approximately 0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The negative-slope region of the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel's current-voltage relation is indispensable for this slow rhythm generation. The time-scale of Na(+)-handling determines the burst's slow frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is best explained mechanistically by using at least two spatial, cable-like compartments: a soma where action potentials are produced and a dendritic compartment where the slow rhythm is generated. Our result is consistent with recent experimental evidence that burst generation originates in distal dendrites (Seutin et al. (1994) Neuroscience 58, 201-206). Responses of the model to a number of electrophysiological and pharmacological stimuli are consistent with known responses observed under similar conditions. These include the persistence of the slow rhythm when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is blocked and when the soma is voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Using our more elaborate model, we account for details of the observed frequency adaptation in N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of multiple spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the interaction between two different bursting mechanisms. Besides reproducing several well established firing patterns, this model also suggests that new firing modes, not yet recorded, might also occur in dopaminergic neurons. This model provides mechanistic insights and explanations into the origin of a variety of experimentally observed membrane potential firing patterns in dopaminergic neurons, including N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting and its dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of dopaminergic neurons, could be useful in further studies of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. It may also shed light on bursting that involves N-methyl-D-aspartate channel activity in other neuron types.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below.\n\n\nModeling N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting in dopamine neurons, Y.X.

We compare the simulation profiles obtained from this two time delay model with those from the other existing models. As a result, we notice many unique features of this two delay model.

A number of mathematical models have been published that attempt to model the temporal [Ca2+]i oscillations. Some, such as the Keizer and De Young model (see  [The De Young-Keizer model, 1992](http://www.cellml.org/models/deyoung_keizer_1992_version03)) assume that IP3 is necessarily oscillatory. They constructed a model of the IP3 receptor/channel by assuming that three equivalent and independent subunits are involved in Ca2+ conduction. Each subunit has three binding sites: one for IP3, one for Ca2+ activation, and one for Ca2+ inactivation. Thus, each subunit may exist in eight states with transitions governed by second-order (association) and first-order (dissociation) rate constants (see below). All three subunits must be in the state S110 (one IP3 and one activating Ca2+ bound) for the channel to be open and conducting.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1994, Yue-Xian Li and John Rinzel analysed the nine-variable De Young-Keizer model (1992) and reduced it to a two-variable system.

Available biophysical data have been incorporated into the model to quantify the specific ultrastructural morphology, intracellular ion buffering, and time- and voltage-dependent currents and transport mechanisms of the rabbit atrial cell. When possible, mathematical expressions describing ionic currents identified in rabbit atrium are based on whole cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rabbit atrial myocytes. This membrane model is coupled to equations describing Na+, K+, and Ca2+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ buffering. The resulting formulation can accurately simulate the whole cell voltage-clamp data on which it is based and provides fits to a family of rabbit atrial cell action potentials obtained at 35 degrees C over a range of stimulus rates (0.2-3.0 Hz). The model is utilized to provide a qualitative prediction of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration transient during the action potential and to illustrate the interactions between membrane currents that underlie repolarization in the rabbit atrial myocyte. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic representation of the Linblad et al 1996 model. |\n\n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model of the action potential and underlying membrane currents in a rabbit atrial cell, D.

At the cellular level, alternans involves beat-to-beat oscillation of the action potential (AP) and possibly Ca2+ transient (CaT). Because of experimental difficulty in independently controlling the Ca2+ and electrical subsystems, mathematical modeling provides additional insights into mechanisms and causality. Pacing protocols were conducted in a canine ventricular myocyte model with the following results: 1) CaT alternans results from refractoriness of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release system; alternation of the L-type calcium current has a negligible effect; 2) CaT-AP coupling during late AP occurs through the sodium-calcium exchanger and underlies AP duration (APD) alternans; 3) increased Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity extends the range of CaT and APD alternans to slower frequencies and increases alternans magnitude; its decrease suppresses CaT and APD alternans, exerting an antiarrhythmic effect; and 4) increase of the rapid delayed rectifier current (IKr) also suppresses APD alternans but without suppressing CaT alternans. Thus CaMKII inhibition eliminates APD alternans by eliminating its cause (CaT alternans) while IKr enhancement does so by weakening CaT-APD coupling. The simulations identify combined CaMKII inhibition and IKr enhancement as a possible antiarrhythmic intervention.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Regulation of Ca2+ and electrical alternans in cardiac myocytes: role of CAMKII and repolarizing currents](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/6/H2854), Leonid M.

        "description": "\n\n#### Model Status\n\n\n\n This model is currently non-functional.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nElectrical activity of the healthy mammalian heart is initiated by an area of specialised pacemaker cells in the wall of the heart, known as the sinoatrial node (SAN). These cells are spontaneously active, demonstrating a slow depolarisation to threshold (pacemaker potential) rather than a stable resting potential. Despite heterogeneity amongst the cells of the SAN, the cells are able to synchronise their firing rate and this in turn stimulates the contraction of the atrial myocardium. Synchronisation is achieved by electronic coupling between cells via gap junctions.\n\n\n\n\nTo date, two potential theories have been put forward to explain the observed spatial heterogeneity in the action potential characteristics within the SAN:\n\n\n\n* 1) The gradient model suggests that the heterogeneity arises intrinsically from a spatial gradient in underlying cellular electrophysiological properties; and\n* 2) The mosaic model, which suggests that atrial myocytes are peppered throughout the SAN region, increasing in density towards the periphery. Action potential heterogeneity then arises due to the electronic coupling between atrial and pacemaker myocytes, and the differences between the relative density of the two cell types with the SAN.\n\n\n\nIn order to further investigate the source of the action potential heterogeneity in the SAN, a mathematical model has been devloped by Lovell *et al*. (see the figure below). Several mathematical models of the SAN activity have been previously published, including:\n\n\n\n* Demir *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 1994;\n* Modelling the Ion Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity, Dokos *et al.*, 1996;\n* A Model of Sinoatrial Node Vagal Control, Dokos *et al.*, 1996;\n* Demir *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 1999;\n* Zhang *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 2000;\n* Boyett *et al.* Sinoatrial Node Model, 2001;\n and \n * Kurata *et al.* Improved Mathematical Model for the Primary Pacemaker Cell, 2002.\n\n\n\nAlthough these models were able to recreate the generic action potential waveforms from the SAN, none were able to represent action potential waveforms from any specific SAN cell. This limits the application of such models to analyse the factors underlying action potential heterogeneity in coupled systems of pacemaker cells, as well as elucidating specific ionic mechanisms underlying action potential heterogeneity in the SAN.\n\n\n\n\nTo meet these needs, Lovell *et al.* have devloped a generic single cell ionic model of rabbit SAN cells, which is based on Markovian state kinetics (all previously published SAN models are based on a Hodgkin-Huxley mechanism). Parameters are fitted to this model using a custom least squares optimisation approach. They then propose a gradient model of the SAN by employing the same optimisation approach to fit a smooth transition in ionic model parameters to achieve a desired variation in AP characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe model has been described here in CellML.

The units have been checked and are consistent and the model runs in both OpenCell and COR to replicate the published results (as shown in figure 3B of the paper).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: Here, we construct a mathematical model of the hypothalamic systems that control the secretion of growth hormone (GH). The work extends a recent model of the pituitary GH system, adding representations of the hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin neurones, each modelled as a single synchronised unit. An unpatterned stochastic input drives the GHRH neurones generating pulses of GHRH release that trigger GH pulses. Delayed feedback from GH results in increased somatostatin release, which inhibits both GH secretion and GHRH release, producing an overall pattern of 3-h pulses of GH secretion that is very similar to the secretory profile observed in male rats. Rather than directly stimulating somatostatin release, GH feedback triggers a priming effect, increasing releasable stores of somatostatin. Varying this priming effect to reduce the effect of GH can reproduce the less pulsatile form of GH release observed in the female rat. The model behaviour is tested by comparison with experimental observations with a range of different experimental protocols involving GHRH injections and somatostatin and GH infusion.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling the hypothalamic control of growth hormone secretion, D.

Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation. At even higher glucose concentrations, continuous action potentials are seen. This electrical activity has two important physiological correlates: increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and increased rate of insulin secretion during the active phase. It is generally accepted that the rise in [Ca2+]i plays a major role in insulin secretion and that the action potential spikes during a burst are responsible for the rise in [Ca2+]i.\n\n\n\n \nBecause the glucose signal for insulin secretion operates via metabolism rather than through a plasma membrane-bound receptor, the details of how glucose stimulates electrical activity have been difficult to resolve. However, experimental data and theoretical models have begun to investigate the phenomenon. In 1997 Gerhard Magnus and Joel Keizer published a minimal mathematical model to describe Ca2+ handling by mitochondria in the pancreatic beta-cell (see [The Magnus-Keizer Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling Model, 1997](http://www.cellml.org/models/magnus_keizer_1997_version01)). Their kinetic model incorporated six transport mechanisms in the inner mitochondrial membrane, including proton pumping via respiration and proton pumping by the F0F1-ATPase, a proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the Ca2+ uniporter and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. In their 1998 model, Gerhard Magnus and Joel Keizer continue their development of a kinetic model of bursting electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. Their minimal model of Ca2+ handling is expanded to include, amongst other factors, the glucose dependence of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing equivalents (see \n the figure\n below). \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Model of beta-cell mitochondrial calcium handling and electrical activity.

However, no currently available detailed action potential model accurately reproduces the dynamics of the cardiac action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling at rapid heart rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35-37 degrees C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Mahajan et al model, featuring whole-cell model showing basic elements of Ca cycling machinery and membrane ion currents, as well as a seven-state Markovian model of the L-type Ca channel. |\n\n\n\nThe original publication reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA rabbit ventricular action potential model replicating cardiac dynamics at rapid heart rates, Mahajan A, Shiferaw Y, Sato D, Baher A, Olcese R, Xie LH, Yang MJ, Chen PS, Restrepo JG, Karma A, Garfinkel A, Qu Z, Weiss JN, 2008 *Biophysical Journal*, 94(2):392-410 [PubMed ID: 18160660](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18160660?ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum)\n\n\n\n\n",

This particular variant of the model uses the initial conditions from the paper (and is not intended to be a steady state model).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger current (I(NCX)). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca(2+) cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca(2+) releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD I(NCX) over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e.g., L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (\"funny\") current (I(f)) conductances]. The system Ca(2+) clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) fluxes, which optimize cell Ca(2+) balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca(2+) release and late DD I(NCX) as SR Ca(2+) pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1.8-4.6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca(2+) clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca(2+) clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD I(NCX) ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca(2+) clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSynergism of coupled subsarcolemmal Ca2+ clocks and sarcolemmal voltage clocks confers robust and flexible pacemaker function in a novel pacemaker cell model, Victor A.

AN example of an autocrine system is signalling through epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). A cell releases EGFR ligands into its environment, and a fraction of the released ligand is recaptured by the receptors at the cell surface. The activated receptors then trigger a signal transduction cascade, whose effects range from cell proliferation to cell migration behaviour. An additional effect can be the further production of EGFR ligands, producing a positive feedback loop which results in a sustained activity of the autocrine signalling circuit. If, as hypothesised, this sustained autoendocrine circuit is localised within a defined domain of the cell, then it may contribute to the intrinsic cell polarity or assymmetry. \n\n\n\n\nThe difficulty associated with the experimental investigation of autoendocrine signalling makes computational modelling especially valuable when trying to deduce nature of the molecular mechanisms underlying signalling circuits. In the Maly *et al.* 2004 publication described here, the authors develop and analyse a dymanic computational model of autocrine EGFR signalling. Their description is based on integrating select elements from the models of [Kholodenko *et al.*, Quantification of EGF Receptor Signalling, 1999](https://models.physiomeproject.org/exposure/bc9af87f2f7a6a301db7887acf8f15da/${HTML_EXMPL_KHOLODENKO_MODEL}), and of [Huang and Ferrell, MAPK Cascade, 1996](http://www.cellml.org/models/huang_ferrell_1996_version03), into the existing model of EGFR aurocrine signalling bt Shvartsman *et al.*, 2002. \n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that although the original Maly *et al.* model is a spatially distributed dynamic computational model, the spatial parameters in this CellML description have been removed, as CellML is currently unable to handle spatial parameters.

Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComplex calcium oscillations and the role of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins, Marko Marhl, Thomas Haberichter, Milan Brumen and Reinhart Heinrich, 2000, *Biosystems*, 57, 75-86.

It is a faithful reproduction of the paper equations, and the output is similar (but not identical) to the published results (Fig 5).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We propose a simple mathematical model of liver S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) metabolism. Analysis of the model has shown that AdoMet metabolism can operate under two different modes. The first, with low metabolic rate and low AdoMet concentration, serves predominantly to supply the cell with AdoMet, the substrate for various cellular methylation reactions. The second, with high metabolic rate and high AdoMet concentration, provides an avenue for cleavage of excess methionine and can serve as a source of cysteine when its increased synthesis is necessary. The switch that triggers interconversion between the \"low\" and \"high\" modes is methionine concentration. Under a certain set of parameters both modes may coexist. This behavior results from the kinetic properties of (i) the two isoenzymes of AdoMet synthetase, MATI and MATIII, that catalyse AdoMet production; one is inhibited by AdoMet, whereas the other is activated by it, and (ii) glycine-N-methyltransferase that displays highly cooperative kinetics that is different from that of other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. Thus, the model provides an explanation for how different cellular needs are met by regulation of this pathway. The model also correctly identifies a critical role for glycine N-methyltransferase in depleting excess methionine in the high mode, thus avoiding the toxicity associated with elevated levels of this essential amino acid. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Substrate Switch: A New Mode of Regulation in the Methionine Metabolic Pathway, Michael V.

Initial rate analysis was performed by hyperbolic regression of initial rates using the program HYPERFIT. Glyoxalase I exhibited saturation kinetics on 0.05-2.5 mM hemithioacetal concentration range, with kinetic parameters Km 0.53 +/- 0.07 mM and V (3.18 +/- 0.16) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1). Glyoxalase II also showed saturation kinetics in the SD-lactoylglutathione concentration range of 0.15-3 mM and Km 0.32 +/- 0.13 mM and V (1.03 +/- 0.10) x 10(-3) mM.min(-1) were obtained. The kinetic parameters of both enzymes were also estimated by nonlinear regression of progress curves using the raw absorbance data and integrated differential rate equations with the program GEPASI. Several optimization methods were used to minimize the sum of squares of residuals. The best parameter fit for the glyoxalase I reaction was obtained with a single curve analysis, using the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model. The kinetic parameters obtained, Km 0.62 +/- 0.18 mM and V (2.86 +/- 0.01) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1), were in agreement with those obtained by initial rate analysis. The results obtained for glyoxalase II, using either the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model or a phenomenological reversible hyperbolic model, showed a high correlation of residuals with time and/or high values of standard deviation associated with Km. The possible causes for the discrepancy between data obtained from initial rate analysis and progress curve analysis, for glyoxalase II, are discussed.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIn situ kinetic analysis of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Margarida Martins, A. *et al*, 2001, *European Journal of Biochemistry*, 268, 3930-3936.

Although the behaviours of single ion channels have been extensively studied experimentally, ionic current interactions make it difficult to deduce their individual roles in membrane excitability. In order to better understand the roles of the individual ion currents, Satoshi Matsuoka *et al.* have developed a mathematical model of membrane excitation for the ventricular cell. \n\n\n\n\nThe Matsuoka *et al.* mathematical model is a development of previously published cardiac cellular models.

In addition, the compound *Kyoto Model* of Matsuoka *et al.* incorporates the Negroni and Lascano (1996) model of cardiac muscle contraction, allowing simulation of sarcomere shortening, and also, the gating model of Shirokov *et al.* is used for both the fast Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels. \n\n\n\n\nNew experimental data are included, such as new kinetics of the inward rectifier K+ channel, the delayed rectifier K+ channel, and the sustained inward current (for more details on the reaction kinetics, see figure 3 below). Model simulations showed that ion conductance by the L-type Ca2+ channel (ICaL) dominates the membrane conductance during the action potential.

Coarse-grained biochemical models, called reduced-order models (ROMs), consisting of essential biochemical mechanisms are more useful for computational analysis and for studying important features of a biochemical network. The authors present a novel method to model-reduction by identifying potentially important parameters using multidimensional sensitivity analysis. A ROM is generated for the GTPase-cycle module of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Gq, and regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (a GTPase-activating protein or GAP) starting from a detailed model of 48 reactions. The resulting ROM has only 17 reactions. The ROM suggested that complexes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and GAP--which were proposed in the detailed model as a hypothesis--are required to fit the experimental data. Models previously published in the literature are also simulated and compared with the ROM. Through this comparison, a minimal ROM, that also requires complexes of GPCR and GAP, with just 15 parameters is generated.

In addition, ion channel gating models provide a quantitative description of gating behaviour and they provide clues to channel strcture. In order to predict the consequences of HERG-KCNE2 interactions for action potential repolarisation, the Markov state model was embedded within the [Winslow *et al.* Canine Ventricular Cell Model, 1999](http://www.cellml.org/models/winslow_rice_jafri_marban_ororke_1999_version03). \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Molecular Interactions Between Two Long-QT Syndrome Gene Products, *HERG* and *KCNE2*, Rationalized by In Vitro and In Silico Analysis](http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/1/33), Reza Mazhari, Joseph L.

        "description": "\n\n#### Model Status\n\n\n\n This model contains partial differentials and as such can not currently be solved by existing CellML tools.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nIn many cell types, Ca2+ acting as a signalling agent plays an important role in the control of cellular function. It is thought that these signals are mediated through oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The mechanisms underlying these oscillations are complex and they have only been partially elucidated. In addition, in larger cells such as in the *Xenopus laevis* oocyte, a variety of Ca2+ wave behaviour has been seen, including plane waves, pulsating patterns and spiral waves. This has lead to the frequent use of *Xenopus* oocytes in experimental studies of Ca2+ waves. \n\n\n\n\nThe probability of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor being in the open state is influenced by both IP3 and Ca2+. This duel system of control is thought to underlie Ca2+ waves and oscillations. IP3 binding to the receptor activates the channel, causing a small amount of Ca2+ to diffuse out of the ER into the cytosol. This Ca2+ has a positive feedback effect, called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), and it is thought to underlie Ca2+ wave propagation. At intermediate IP3 concentrations, a stable limit cycle appears in the kinetics, and the model becomes oscillatory. Under these conditions, wave propagation can occur even without excitability.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral mathematical models for Ca2+ wave propagation have been published (for some examples see [DeYoung and Keizer's IP3-mediated Ca2+ release model, 1992](http://www.cellml.org/models/deyoung_keizer_1992_version03) and [Li and Rinzel's IP3-mediated Ca2+ oscillations model, 1994](http://www.cellml.org/models/li_rinzel_1994_version02)), all of which are similar. The mathematical model described here was published by McKenzie and Sneyd in 1998 (see \n the figure\n below). It describes the process by which IP3 diffuses through the cytosol and binds to receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These receptors also function as Ca2+ channels. They open upon IP3 binding, and Ca2+ diffuses out of the ER down its electrochemical gradient into the cytosol. Ca2+ is pumped against its electrochemical gradient out of the cytosol into the ER, and ions also leak into the cytosol from the ER and the external environment as they diffuse into the cytosol down their electrochemical gradient. \n\n\n\n\nModel simulations showed that spiral waves could be induced by simulating the release of IP3. Increasing the size of the IP3 additions caused a decrease in the rotation period and the breakup of the spiral wave solutions. Following this, irregular spatio-temporal patterns occurred.

The simulation consisted of a forward dynamic 3-D musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity, scaled to represent a specific subject. Inputs of the model were the initial position and velocity of the skeletal elements, and the muscle stimulation patterns. Outputs of the model were movement and ground reaction forces, as well as resultant 3-D forces and moments acting across the knee joint. An optimization method was established to find muscle stimulation patterns that best reproduced the subject's movement and ground reaction forces during a sidestepping task. The optimized model produced movements and forces that were generally within one standard deviation of the measured subject data. Resultant knee joint loading variables extracted from the optimized model were comparable to those reported in the literature. The ability of the model to successfully predict the subject's response to altered initial conditions was quantified and found acceptable for use of the model to investigate the effect of altered neuromuscular control on knee joint loading during sidestepping. Monte Carlo simulations (N = 100,000) using randomly perturbed initial kinematic conditions, based on the subject's variability, resulted in peak anterior force, valgus torque and internal torque values of 378 N, 94 Nm and 71 Nm, respectively, large enough to cause ACL rupture. We conclude that the procedures described in this paper were successful in creating valid simulations of normal movement, and in simulating injuries that are caused by perturbed neuromuscular control.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of a 3-D model to predict knee joint loading during dynamic movement, S.G.

We have proposed that the Phase 1 response results from the combined depolarizing influences of potassium channel closure and an inward, nonselective cation current (ICRAN) that activates as intracellular calcium stores empty during exposure to basal glucose (Bertram et al., 1995). The stores refill during Phase 1, deactivating ICRAN and allowing steady-state bursting to commence. We support this hypothesis with additional simulations and experimental results indicating that Phase 1 duration is sensitive to the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. First, the duration of the Phase 1 transient increases with duration of prior exposure to basal (2.8 mM) glucose, reflecting the increased time required to fill calcium stores that have been emptying for longer periods. Second, Phase 1 duration is reduced when islets are exposed to elevated K+ to refill calcium stores in the presence of basal glucose. Third, when extracellular calcium is removed during the basal glucose exposure to reduce calcium influx into the stores, Phase 1 duration increases. Finally, no Phase 1 is observed following hyperpolarization of the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide in the continued presence of 11 mm glucose, a condition in which intracellular calcium stores remain full. Application of carbachol to empty calcium stores during basal glucose exposure did not increase Phase 1 duration as the model predicts. Despite this discrepancy, the good agreement between most of the experimental results and the model predictions provides evidence that a calcium release-activated current mediates the Phase 1 electrical response of the pancreatic beta-cell.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nEvidence That Calcium Release-activated Current Mediates the Biphasic Electrical Activity of Mouse Pancreatic *Journal name*, edition, firstpage-lastpage.

(Circ. Res 1999, 84:571-586) by incorporating equations for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) buffering and transport by ATP and ADP and equations for MgATP regulation of ion transporters (Na(+)-K(+) pump, sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) pumps). The results indicate that, under normal conditions, Ca(2+) binding by low-affinity ATP and diffusion of CaATP may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The model also suggests that a fall in ATP/ADP ratio significantly reduces sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) content, increases diastolic Ca(2+), lowers systolic Ca(2+), increases Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels, and decreases the efficiency of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in extruding Ca(2+) during periodic voltage-clamp stimulation. The analysis suggests that the most important reason for these changes during metabolic inhibition is the down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase pump by reduced diastolic MgATP levels. High Ca(2+) concentrations developed near the membrane might have a greater influence on Mg(2+), ATP, and ADP concentrations than that of the lower Ca(2+) concentrations in the bulk myoplasm. The model predictions are in general agreement with experimental observations measured under normal and pathological conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModel study of ATP and ADP buffering, transport of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), and regulation of ion pumps in ventricular myocyte, Anushka Michailova and Andrew McCulloch, 2001, *Biophysical Journal*, 81, 614-629.

Based on real morphological and electrophysiological data, the model assumes that: the functional unit is an electromyogenic syncytium; the kinetics of L-type Ca2+, T-type Ca2+, Ca2+-activated K+, voltage dependent K+and Cl-channels determine the electrical activity of the functional unit; the enteric nervous system is satisfactorily represented by an efferent cholinergic neuron that provides an excitatory input to the functional unit through receptor-linked L-type Ca2+channels and by an afferent pathway composed of the primary and secondary sensory neurons; the dynamics of propagation of the wave of depolarization along the unmyelinated nerve axons satisfy the Hodgkin-Huxley model; the electrical activity of the neural soma reflects the interaction of N-type Ca2+channels, Ca2+-activated K+and voltage dependent Na+, K+and Cl-channels; the smooth muscle syncytium of the locus is a null-dimensional contractile system. With the proposed model the dynamics of active force generation are determined entirely by the concentration of cytosolic calcium. The model describes: the mechanical excitation of the free nerve endings of the mechanoreceptor of the receptive field of the pathway; the electrical processes of the propagation of excitation along the afferent and efferent neural circuits; the chemical mechanisms of nerve-pulse transmission at the synaptic zones; the slow wave and bursting type electrical activity; cytosolic calcium concentration; the dynamics of active force generation.

We used the latch regulation scheme of Hai and Murphy (Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 255:C86-C94, 1988) integrated with Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. This analysis showed that imposed length fluctuations decrease the mean number of attached bridges, depress muscle force and stiffness, and increase force-length hysteresis. At frequencies >0.1 Hz, the bond-length distribution of slowly cycling latch bridges changed little over the stretch cycle and contributed almost elastically to muscle force, but the rapidly cycling cross-bridge distribution changed substantially and dominated the hysteresis. By contrast, at frequencies greater than 0.033 Hz this behavior was reversed: the rapid cycling cross-bridge distribution changed little, effectively functioning as a constant force generator, while the latch bridge bond distribution changed substantially and dominated the stiffness and hysteresis. The analysis showed the dissociation of force/length hysteresis and cross-bridge cycling rates when strain amplitude exceeds 3%; that is, there is only a weak coupling between net external mechanical work and the ATP consumption required for cycling cross-bridges during the oscillatory steady state. Although these results are specific to airway smooth muscle, the approach generalizes to other smooth muscles subjected to cyclic length fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nPerturbed Equilibria of Myosin Binding in Airway Smooth Muscle: Bond-Length Distributions, Mechanics, and ATP Metabolism, Srboljub M.

The mechanism of this intriguing energetics remained unknown. To get insights into this mechanism, we simulated myocardial cooling mechanoenergetics using basic Ca2+ and CB kinetics. We assumed that both adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake and CB detachment decelerated with cooling. We also assumed that all the ATPase-independent SR Ca2+ release, Ca2+ binding to and dissociation from troponin, and CB attachment remained unchanged. The simulated cooling shifted the CB force-free Ca2+ concentration curve to a lower Ca2+ concentration, increasing the Ca2+ responsiveness of CB force generation, and increased the maximum Ca2+-activated force. The simulation most importantly showed that these cooling effects combined led to a constant contractile efficiency when Ca2+ uptake and CB detachment rate constants changed appropriately. This result seems to account for our experimentally observed constant contractile efficiency under cooling inotropy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Mikane et al model.

This allows us to determine rather completely how the parameters in the model affect its behavior which in turn provides insight into the effects of the many parameters in more realistic models. (3) It naturally gives rise to a one-dimensional map which specifies the action potential duration as a function of the previous diastolic interval. For certain parameter values, this map exhibits a new phenomenon--subcritical alternans--that does not occur for the commonly used exponential map.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A two-current model for the dynamics of cardiac membrane, Colleen C.

Assuming that the variation among cells with respect to this 'intracellular' delay can be approximated by a gamma distribution, a high flexible distribution that can mimic a variety of biologically plausible delays, we provide analytical solutions for the expected decline in plasma virus concentration after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy with one or more protease inhibitors. We then use the model to investigate whether the parameters that characterize viral dynamics can be identified from biological data. Using non-linear least-squares regression to fit the model to simulated data in which the delays conform to a gamma distribution, we show that good estimates for free viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and parameters characterizing the gamma distribution can be obtained. For simulated data sets in which the delays were generated using other biologically plausible distributions, reasonably good estimates for viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and mean delay times can be obtained using the gamma-delay model. For simulated data sets that include added simulated noise, viral clearance rate estimates are not as reliable. If the mean intracellular delay is known, however, we show that reasonable estimates for the viral clearance rate can be obtained by taking the harmonic mean of viral clearance rate estimates from a group of patients. These results demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate distributed intracellular delays into existing models for HIV dynamics and to use these refined models to estimate the half-life of free virus from data on the decline in HIV-1 RNA following treatment. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInfluence of Delayed Viral Production on Viral Dynamics in HIV-1 Infected Patients, John E.

        "description": "\n\n\nModel Status\n------------\n\n\nThis CellML model is known to run in OpenCell and recreate the results as shown in the publication.\nModel Structure\n---------------\n\n\nABSTRACT:Purkinje cells play an important role in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis and are widely used in preclinical drug safety assessments. Repolarization abnormalities such as action potential (AP) prolongation and early afterdeploarizations (EAD) are often observed in vitro upon pharmacological interventions. However, because drugs do not act on only one defined target, it is often difficult to fully explain the mechanisms of action and their potential arrhythmogenicity. Computational models, when appropriately detailed and validated, can be used to gain mechanistic insights into the mechanisms of action of certain drugs. Nevertheless, no model of Purkinje electrophysiology that is able to reproduce characteristic Purkinje responses to drug-induced changes in ionic current conductances such as AP prolongation and EAD generation currently exists. In this study, a novel biophysically detailed model of rabbit Purkinje electrophysiology was developed by integration of data from voltage-clamp and AP experimental recordings. Upon validation, we demonstrate that the model reproduces many key electrophysiological properties of rabbit Purkinje cells. These include: AP morphology and duration, both input resistance and rate dependence properties as well as response to hyperkalemia. Pharmacological interventions such as inward rectifier K+ current and rapid delayed rectifier K+ current block as well as late Na+ current increase result in significant AP changes. However, enhanced L-type Ca2+ current (iCaL) dominates in EAD genesis in Purkinje fibers. In addition, iCaL inactivation dynamics and intercellular coupling in tissue strongly modulate EAD formation. We conclude that EAD generation in Purkinje cells is mediated by an increase in iCaL and modulated by its inactivation kinetics.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n[Ionic mechanisms of electrophysiological properties and repolarization abnormalities in rabbit Purkinje fibers](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21335469), Corrias A, Giles W, Rodriguez B, 2011, [American Journal of Physiology Heart and Circulatory Physiology](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/), 2011 May;300(5):H1806-13.

The IP3 - calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data we construct a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by a hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1), in the mouse atrial cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient; including the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and binding kinetics to precoupled (with G{alpha}GDP) receptor, and the kinetics associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics associated with the receptor system contribute to the behaviour of the system to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterising for a second hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway. \n\n\n*Abstract reproduced from Cooling et al., Biophysical Journal 93, 2007, with permission.*\n\n\nThis model of the NFAT cycling system is described in more depth in the original paper which is cited below:\n\n\nModeling hypertrophic IP3 transients in the cardiac myocyte, Michael Cooling, Peter Hunter and Edmund J.

The extracellular ligand (L) binds to receptors (R), whether precoupled with GaGDP (Gd, yielding Rlg) or not (Rl). Fully activated receptors (Rlg) release GaGTP (Gt), which, along with calcium (Ca), stimulates PLCb (P). In the unstimulated state, PLCb-Ca21 (Pc) hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce IP3 via reaction R14. When stimulated, PLCb-Ca21-GaGTP (Pcg) hydrolyses PIP2 at a faster rate via reaction R15. Free IP3 is degraded via reaction R16.*\n\n\n\n Related models: A more modular version of this model is available at [Modeling Biological Modularity with CellML](http://models.cellml.org/workspace/cooling_hunter_crampin_CellML_2008).\n \n\n\n\n",

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and T cell interaction, Helen Moore and Natasha K.

Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials.

        "description": "\n\n#### Model Status\n\n\n\n This model contains partial differentials and as such can not currently be solved by existing CellML tools.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nThrough the continuous activity of ion pumps in the plasma membrane, relatively steep transmembrane electrochemical gradients are maintained. Because the transmembrane distributions of many ions such as Na+, K+ and Ca2+ are far from equilibrium, cells are inclined towards excitable electrical activity, or the membrane potential, determined by relative charge distribution, exhibits complicated patterns of slow and fast oscillations associated with variations in the transmembrane ionic currents. These dynamics play an essential role in intracellular function and intercellular communication. \n\n\n\n\nWhen exposed to a threshold concentration of glucose, pancreatic beta-cells exhibit a complicated pattern of electrical activity. Bursts of action potential spikes (the \"active\" phase) are observed, separated by a \"silent\" phase of membrane repolarisation. Insulin secretion is dependent on the relative amount of time the cells spend in the active state, and this time increases with the concentration of extracellular glucose. Bursting dynamics control the influx of Ca2+ into the cell, and in turn, Ca2+ triggers the release of insulin. So, via this mechanism, the bursting dynamics of the pancreatic beta-cells regulate their response to varying glucose concentrations. Below a threshold glucose concentration (about 5mM), the cells do not burst. Above a certain concentration (> 22 mM), the cells display continuous spiking, and insulin secretion becomes saturated. \n\n\n\n\nMathematical models of pancreatic beta-cells are usually based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (for the original model see [The Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Axon Model, 1952](http://www.cellml.org/models/hodgkin_huxley_1952_version07)), with elaborations to account for Ca2+ storage, glucose metabolism, and regulation by ATP and various hormones. Several models have been published (see [the CellML repository](http://www.cellml.org/models) for more pancreatic beta-cell and calcium oscillation models), but although some have been established for some years, their bifurcation structure is so complicated it is not yet fully understood. The goal of the 2001 Mosekilde *et al.* paper analysed here was to give an accurate, but simplified account of the bifurcation structure of the individual beta-cell (see \n the figure\n below).\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Bifurcation structure of a model of bursting pancreatic cells](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T2K-4447MJD-J&_user=140507&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2001&_alid=70440630&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=4921&_sort=d&_docanchor=&wchp=dGLbVlz-lSzBk&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=dc19bf053e438dae9918fa3c279f2f7e), Erik Mosekilde, Brian Lading, Sergiy Yanchuk and Yuri Maistrenko, 2001, [*Biosystems*](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=JournalURL&_cdi=4921&_auth=y&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=511bbadc6ebfd16e10115a252026e228), 63, 3-13.

Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl- (NKCC1) and the Na+/HCO3- (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n\n\nAstrocytic mechanisms explaining neural-activity-induced shrinkage of extraneuronal space, I.

Model variables include the concentrations of Na, K, Cl, and HCO3, pH, cell volume, and electrical potential. The model equations specify mass conservation and chemical equilibrium for buffer reactions. Ionic conductance is represented by the Goldman constant-field equation. For the intercalated cells, phenomenological expressions describing the proton pumps are structured to agree with data of O. S. Andersen, J. E. N. Silveira, and P. R. Steinmetz (J. Gen. Physiol. 86: 215-234, 1985) in the turtle bladder. Coupled transport via Na/H and Cl/HCO3 exchangers is represented according to the formalism of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. To construct the tubule model, the flat epithelium is wrapped into a cylinder, creating a luminal compartment. Luminal variables include volume flow, hydrostatic pressure, electrical potential, and ionic concentrations. A specific aim of this investigation was to simulate the capability of the epithelium to maintain Na reabsorption in the presence of low luminal salt concentration. In this regard, critical features of the model include tight junctional conductance and the apical Na permeability of the principal cell. In particular, we examine a principal cell apical Na permeability inversely dependent on luminal and intracellular Na concentrations (M. M. Civan and R. J. Bookman. J. Membr. Biol. 65: 63-80, 1982). This concentration-dependent permeability together with a low junctional conductance produces three results congruent with experimental data: 1) dilution of luminal Na and maintenance of reabsorptive Na transport despite a steep transtubular gradient, 2) a relatively constant level of K secretion over a wide range of luminal Na concentrations, and 3) a relatively constant transepithelial potential over this range of luminal Na.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n\n\nA mathematical model of the rabbit cortical collecting tubule, J.

A two-dimensional musculoskeletal model which consisted of four rigid segments, three joints, and six Hill-type muscle models, representing the six major muscles and muscle groups in the lower extremity that contribute to jumping performance, was trained systematically. Maximum isometric muscle force, maximum muscle shortening velocity, and maximum muscle activation, which were manipulated to simulate the effects of strength training, all had substantial effects on jumping performance. Part of the increase in jumping performance could be explained solely by the interaction between the three neuromuscular parameters. It appeared that the most effective way to improve jumping performance was to train the knee extensors among all lower extremity muscles. For the model to fully benefit from any training effects of the neuromuscular system, it was necessary to continue to reoptimize the muscle coordination, in particular after the strength training sessions that focused on increasing maximum isometric muscle force. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\nEffects of Neuromuscular Strength Training on Vertical Jumping Performance - A Computer Simulation Study, Akinori Nagano and Karin G.M.

For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100%, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection..\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model of HIV-1 pathogenesis that includes an intracellular delay, Patrick W.

The proposed interfering virus, which is designed to superinfect HIV-1 infected cells, carries ribozymes that cleave conserved regions in HIV-1 RNA that code for the viral envelope protein. Thus DIV infection of HIV-1 infected cells should reduce or eliminate viral production by these cells. The success of this therapeutic strategy will depend both on the intercellular interaction of DIV and HIV-1, and on the overall dynamics of virus and T cells in the body. To study these dynamical issues, we have constructed a mathematical model of the interaction of HIV-1, DIV, and CD4+ cells in vivo. The results of both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that survival of the engineered DIV purely on a peripheral blood HIV-1 infection is unlikely. However, analytical results indicate that DIV might well survive on HIV-1 infected CD4+ cells in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and spleen, or on other HIV-1 infected cells in these organs.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic illustration of the main features of the model. |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling defective interfering virus therapy for AIDS: conditions for DIV survival, Nelson G, Perelson A, 1995, *Mathematical Biosciences*, 125, 127-153.

The analysis indicates that the major initial effect of IFN is to block virion production or release, with blocking efficacies of 81, 95, and 96% for daily doses of 5, 10, and 15 million international units, respectively. The estimated virion half-life (t1/2) was, on average, 2.7 hours, with pretreatment production and clearance of 10(12) virions per day. The estimated infected cell death rate exhibited large interpatient variation (corresponding t1/2 = 1.7 to 70 days), was inversely correlated with baseline viral load, and was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels. Fast death rates were predictive of virus being undetectable by polymerase chain reaction at 3 months. These findings show that infection with hepatitis C virus is highly dynamic and that early monitoring of viral load can help guide therapy. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C viral dynamics in vivo and the antiviral efficacy of interferon-alpha therapy, Avidan U.

How such self-tolerance is achieved is still a subject of debate. The belief that autoimmunity poses a continuous threat to the organism was challenged by data demonstrating that autoimmunity has a protective function after traumatic injury to the central nervous system. This finding led us to suggest the 'comprehensive immunity' approach by which autoimmunity is viewed as a special case of immunity, namely as a defense mechanism that operates by fighting against the threat of potential destructive activity originated or mediated within the organism, similarly to the immune defense that operates against the threat from exogenous pathogens. We present a primary mathematical spatio-temporal model that supports this concept. The numerical solutions of this model illustrate the beneficial operation of a well-controlled immune response specific to self-antigens residing in the site of lesion. The model also explains how the response to self might be tolerated on a day-to-day basis. In addition, we demonstrate that the same autoimmune response, operating at different levels of regulation, can lead to either an autoimmune disease or a degenerative disorder. This preliminary qualitative model supports our contention that the way autoimmunity is perceived should be revised.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nAutoimmunity as an immune defense against degenerative processes: a primary mathematical model illustrating the bright side of autoimmunity, Uri Nevo, Ido Golding, Avidan U.

In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca2+]i transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+ sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram depicting the relationships of the active contraction framework proposed by Hunter et al.

We performed simulations in the presence of stretch-dependent increases in flux through the Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (AE), stretch-activated channels (SAC), and the stretch-dependent nitric oxide (NO) induced increased open probability of the ryanodine receptors to estimate the capacity of each mechanism to produce the slow force response (SFR). Inclusion of stretch-dependent NHE & AE, SACs, and stretch-dependent NO effects caused an increase in tension following 15 min of stretch of 0.87%, 32%, and 0%, respectively. Comparing [Ca2+]i dynamics before and after stretch in the presence of combinations of the three stretch-dependent elements, which produced significant SFR values (>20%), showed that the inclusion of stretch-dependent NO effects produced [Ca2+]i transients, which were not consistent with experimental results. Further simulations showed that in the presence of SACs and the absence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE inhibition of NHE attenuated the SFR, such that reduced SFR in the presence of NHE blockers does not indicate a stretch dependence of NHE. Rather, a functioning NHE is responsible for a portion of the SFR. Based on our simulations we estimate that in rat cardiac myocytes at room temperature SACs play a significant role in producing the SFR, potentially in the presence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE and that NO effects, if any, must involve more mechanisms than just increasing the open probability of ryanodine receptors.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original publication reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nA mathematical model of the slow force response to stretch in rat ventricular myocytes, Steven Niederer, Nicholas Smith, 2007.\n *Biophysical Journal*, 92 (11) 4030-4044, [PubMed ID: 17369410](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17369410)\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of the mathematical model. |\n\n\n\n",

The units have been checked and they are consistent. \n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nIn 1962, Denis Noble published one of the first mathematical models of a cardiac cell. By adapting the equations of the original Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon model (1952), Noble described the long lasting action and pace-maker potentials of the Purkinje fibres of the heart. The potassium-current equations differ from those of Hodgkin and Huxley in that the potassium ions are assumed to flow through two types of channel in the membrane. By contrast, the sodium current equations are very similar to those of Hodgkin and Huxley.\n\n\n\n\nThe main failure of the Noble (1962) model is that it only includes one voltage gated inward current, INa. Calcium currents had not yet been discovered, but there was a clue in the model that something was missing. The only way the model could be made to work was to greatly extend the voltage range of the sodium current by reducing the voltage dependence of the sodium activation process. In effect the sodium current was made to serve the function of both the sodium and the calcium channels as far as the plateau is concerned. There was a clear experimental prediction: either sodium channels in the heart are quantitatively different from those in neurons, or other inward current-carrying channels must exist. Both predictions are correct.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Modification of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Applicable to Purkinje Fibre Action and Pace-maker Potentials, Noble, D. 1962 \n *Journal of Physiology*\n , 160, 317-352.

This model is known to run in COR and OpenCell.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nIntroduction: The idea that sodium-calcium exchange might generate a current during cardiac electrical activity was first raised as a possible mechanism for the pathological situation when calcium-overloaded tissue generates the transient inward current responsible for ectopic beating. This was one of the mechanisms proposed by Kass, Lederer, Tsien,\nand Weingart in 1978. Mullins had already suggested on theoretical grounds that a variety of currents flowing across the cardiac cell membrane might be carried by sodium-calcium exchange. With regard to the transient inward current, the evidence that it is carried mostly (though not entirely) by sodium-calcium exchange is now very strong in ventricular cells,4 and it has proved possible to reproduce this mechanism in computer models of cardiac electrical activity. The purpose of the present paper is to review the evidence, experimental and theoretical, for a major role of the sodium-calcium exchange current during normal cardiac rhythm. \n\n\n\n\nBrown et al. and Arlock and Noble recorded slow components of inward current following the calcium current that were attributed to sodium-calcium exchange activated by the intracellular calcium transient, while Mitchell et al. and Schouten and ter Keurs showed that the exchange current could play a major role in maintaining the late low plateau in rat ventricular cells. Several years previously Simurda et al. showed that a component of inward current during weak depolarizations is directly proportional to contractile force, suggesting that it was calcium activated.\n \n\n\n\nUntil 1987 it has to be admitted that these explanations were always subject to the criticism that the currents concerned were measured in highly complex situations with many other current components also present. Of course, if the role of sodium-calcium exchange during normal cellular activity is to be assessed, such experiments are necessary,\nand we will describe more of them later in this paper. But they need to be backed up by experiments done under conditions where the exchange current is isolated from other components. This was first achieved by Kimura, Miyamae, and Noma in 1987. The results were very relevant indeed, not only because they showed the electrogenic\nnature of the sodium-calcium exchange in cardiac cells (including demonstrating that\nits most likely stoichiometry was 3 : 1) but also because the current-voltage relations\nobtained were very similar to those required theoretically in modeling work to explain the results obtained in normal beating cardiac tissue.\n \n\n\n\nIt is no longer necessary, therefore, to prove the hypothesis that sodium-calcium exchange contributes a significant electric current. The question now is rather a functional one: How large can this current be and can it be sufficient to be primarily responsible for maintaining calcium balance in the heart by generating the major\ncomponent of calcium efflux? This is the hypothesis that led to the experimental and\nmodeling work done by Hilgemann and Noble. In this paper, we will describe experiments done on atrial and ventricular cells that attempt to refine this hypothesis. We will raise the question of how the contribution of\nsodium-calcium exchange to the action potential varies with the region of the heart from which the cells come, with the ionic concentration levels (in particular of internal ion concentrations) and with inotropic state.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic diagram describing the current flows across the cell membrane that are captured in the Noble 1991 model. |\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Sodium-Calcium Exchange During the Cardiac Action Potential, by Noble D, Noble SJ, Bett GC, Earm YE, Ho WK, So IK, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1991;639:334-53.\n [PubMed ID: 1785860](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1785860) \n\n\n\n\n",

The calcium in this space is also assumed to play the major role in calcium-induced inactivation of the calcium current. Delayed potassium current equations have been developed to include the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed rectifier current based on the data of of Heath and Terrar, along with data from Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz. Length- and tension-dependent changes in mechanical and electrophysiological processes have been incorporated as described recently by Kohl et al. Drug receptor interactions have started to be developed, using the sodium channel as the first target. The new model has been tested against experimental data on action potential clamp, and on force-interval and duration-interval relations; it has been found to reliably reproduce experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nImproved guinea-pig ventricular cell model incorporating a diadic space, IKr and IKs, and length- and tension-dependent processes, Denis Noble, Anthony Varghese, Peter Kohl and Penelope Noble, 1998, *Can J Cardiol*, 14, 123-134.

In order to reproduce the figures in the published paper, initial concentrations for the variables need to be obtained from the author, as they are not listed in the paper. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nDuring mitotic cell division, eukaryotic cells will replicate their DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, and then divide during the M-phase (see \n the figure\n below). S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, G1 and G2 phases. These discrete phases of the cell cycle are carefully regulated by specific proteins, and in most eukaryotic cells, cell cycle events are coordinated at three checkpoints:\n\n\n* In G1 phase, cells analyse both their external environment and their intracellular state before committing to a new cycle of DNA synthesis and division.\n* In the G2 phase, the cell checks that DNA synthesis and repair are complete, and that the cell has reached a critical size before mitosis is initiated.\n* Thirdly, at metaphase, the cell ensures that all chromosomes are correctly aligned on the central plate before they are separated to opposite poles of the spindle.\n\n\n\nOver the past few years advances in molecular genetics have lead to the elucidation of many of the molecular details of these control mechanisms. But although cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are known to trigger the major events of the cell cycle, the precise mechanisms of the checkpoint controls are still uncertain.\n\n\n\n\nConcurrent with advances in experimental techniques and the generation of molecular data, mathematical models of increasing complexity have evolved. In the study described here, Novak *et al.* develop a mathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1/S, G2/M and metaphase/anaphase transitions (see \n the figure\n below). Much is known about the physiology, genetics and molecular biology of the fission yeast (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*). By varying the parameter values of their model, the authors were able to represent both wild-type and *wee1-* mutant cells. They found that their model was consistent with the observed phenotypes of many different mutant fission yeast strains, and it also was able to predict interesting phenotypes for some multiple-mutant strains that have not yet been constructed and analysed. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1/S, G2/M and metaphase/anaphase transitions, Bela Novak, Attila Csikasz-Nagy, Bela Gyorffy, Kathy Chen, and John J.

Can these molecular components be spun together into a consistent mechanism that accounts for the observed behavior of growth and division in fission yeast cells? To answer this question, we propose a mechanism for the control system, convert it into a set of 14 differential and algebraic equations, study these equations by numerical simulation and bifurcation theory, and compare our results to the physiology of wild-type and mutant cells. In wild-type cells, progress through the cell cycle (G1-->S-->G2-->M) is related to cyclic progression around a hysteresis loop, driven by cell growth and chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate. However, the control system operates much differently in double-mutant cells, wee1(-) cdc25Delta, which are defective in progress through the latter half of the cell cycle (G2 and M phases). These cells exhibit \"quantized\" cycles (interdivision times clustering around 90, 160, and 230 min). We show that these quantized cycles are associated with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the mechanism, when the wee1 and cdc25 genes are disabled.

Here, a simple mathematical approach is developed to explore the relation between antiviral immune responses, virus load, and virus diversity. The model results are compared to data on cytotoxic T cell responses and viral diversity in infections with the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1).\n\n\n\n Population dynamics of immune responses to persistent viruses, Nowak, MA and Bangham, CR, 1996, *Science*\n , 272, 74-79 [PubMed ID: 8600540](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8600540)\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of a model for virus-CTL interaction. |\n\n\n\n",

This model describes the regulation of the G1-phase that includes the interactions of the nuclear proteins, RB, cyclin E, cyclin D, cdk2, cdk4 and E2F. The effects of the growth factors on cyclin D synthesis under saturated or unsaturated growth factor conditions are investigated based on this model. The solutions to this model (a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations) are discussed with respect to existing experiments. Predictions based on mathematical analysis of this model are presented. In particular, results are presented on the existence of two stablesolutions, i.e., bistability within the G1-phase. It is shown that this bistability exists under unsaturated growth factor concentration levels. This phenomenon is very noticeable if the efficiency of the signal transduction, initiated by the growth factors leading to cyclin D synthesis, is low. The biological significance of this result as well as possible experimental designs to test these predictions are presented.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n A model of cell cycle behavior dominated by kinetics of a pathway stimulated by growth factors, Mandri N.

At present it does not reproduce the published results, although the equations are a faithful match to the paper.

These intermediates inactivate many types of biomolecules, including peroxidase itself. Previously, we have shown that oscillatory dynamics in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction seem to protect the enzyme from inactivation. It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Mechanism of protection of peroxidase activity by oscillatory dynamics, Lars F.

Despite intensive research in intracellular calcium signalling it is an unsolved riddle how the different types of information represented by the different agonists, is encoded using the universal carrier calcium. It is also still not clear how the information encoded is decoded again into the intracellular specific information at the site of enzymes and genes. After the discovery of calcium oscillations, one likely mechanism is that information is encoded in the frequency, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. This hypothesis has received some experimental support. However, the mechanism of decoding of oscillatory signals is still not known. Here, we study a mechanistic model of calcium oscillations, which is able to reproduce both spiking and bursting calcium oscillations. We use the model to study the decoding of calcium signals on the basis of co-operativity of calcium binding to various proteins. We show that this co-operativity offers a simple way to decode different calcium dynamics into different enzyme activities.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the encoding and decoding of calcium signals in hepatocytes, Ann Zahle Larsen, Lars Folke Olsen, Ursula Kummer, 2004 *Biophysical Chemistry*, 107, 83-89.

Mathematically these are cast into the form of partial differential equations. Because of nonlinear material behaviour, inhomogeneous properties and usually a complex geometry, it is impossible to find closed-form analytical solutions for these sets of equations. The objective of the finite element method is to find approximate solutions for these problems. The concepts of the finite element method are explained on a finite element continuum model of skeletal muscle. In this case, the momentum equations have to be solved with an extra constraint, because the material behaves as nearly incompressible. The material behaviour consists of a highly nonlinear passive part and an active part. The latter is described with a two-state Huxley model. This means that an extra nonlinear partial differential equation has to be solved. The problems and solutions involved with this procedure are explained. The model is used to describe the mechanical behaviour of a tibialis anterior of a rat. The results have been compared with experimentally determined strains at the surface of the muscle. Qualitatively there is good agreement between measured and calculated strains, but the measured strains were higher.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nFinite element modelling of contracting skeletal muscle, C.W.J.

Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model.

In addition to the formulation given by the paper and the author's later Corrections document, the IStim current has been adjusted to produce 1 Hz stimulations for 10 seconds.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Mathematical models were developed to reconstruct the action potentials (AP) recorded in epicardial and endocardial myocytes isolated from the adult rat left ventricle. The main goal was to obtain additional insight into the ionic mechanisms responsible for the transmural AP heterogeneity. The simulation results support the hypothesis that the smaller density and the slower reactivation kinetics of the Ca(2+)-independent transient outward K(+) current (I(t)) in the endocardial myocytes can account for the longer action potential duration (APD), and more prominent rate dependence in that cell type. The larger density of the Na(+) current (I(Na)) in the endocardial myocytes results in a faster upstroke (dV/dt(max)). This, in addition to the smaller magnitude of I(t), is responsible for the larger peak overshoot of the simulated endocardial AP. The prolonged APD in the endocardial cell also leads to an enhanced amplitude of the sustained K(+) current (I(ss)), and a larger influx of Ca(2+) ions via the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)). The latter results in an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) load, which is mainly responsible for the higher peak systolic value of the Ca(2+) transient [Ca(2+)](i), and the resultant increase in the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (I(NaCa)) activity, associated with the simulated endocardial AP.

(1992) J. Membrane Biol. 125:49-62) were evaluated in terms of a kinetic model. The steady-state and presteady-state cotransporter properties are described by a 6-state ordered kinetic model (\"mirror\" symmetry) with a Na:aMDG stoichiometry of 2. Carrier translocation in the membrane as well as Na and sugar binding and dissociation are treated as a function of their individual rate constants. Empty carrier translocation and Na binding/dissociation are the only steps considered to be voltage dependent. Currents were associated with the translocation of the negatively charged carrier in the membrane. Negative membrane potential facilitates sugar transport. One numerical solution was found for the 14 rate constants that account quantitatively for our experiment observations: i.e., (i) sigmoidal shape of the sugar-specific current-voltage curves (absence of outward currents and inward current saturation at high negative potentials), (ii) Na and voltage dependence of K\\_0.5\\_sugar and i\\_max\\_sugar , (iii) sugar and voltage dependence of K\\_0.5\\_Na and i\\_max\\_Na, (iv) presteady-state currents and their dependence on external Na, aMDG and membrane potential, and (v) and carrier Na leak current. We conclude that the main voltage effect is on carrier translocation. Na ions that migrate from the extracellular medium to their binding sites sense 25 to 35% of the transmembrane voltage, whereas charges associated with the carrier translocation experiences 60 to 75% of the membrane electrical field. Internal Na ion binding is not voltage dependent. In our nonrapid equilibrium model, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is a function of the membrane potential, [Na]o and [aMDG]o. At 0 mV and at saturating [Na]o and [aMDG]o, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is the empty carrier translocation (5 sec-1). As the membrane potential is made more negative, the empty carrier translocation gets faster and the internal Na dissociation becomes increasingly rate limiting. However, as [Na]o is decreased to less than 10 mM, the ratelimiting step is the external Na ions binding in the 0 to -150 mV potential range. At 0 mV, the external Na dissociation constant KNa' is 80 mM and decreases to 24 mM at -150 mV. The external sugar dissociation constant KNaS' is estimated to be 200 microM and voltage independent. Finally, the internal leak pathway (CNa2 translocation) is insignificant. While we cannot rule out a more complex kinetic model, the electrical properties of the cloned Na/glucose cotransporter are found to be adequately described by this 6-state kinetic model.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n Electrogenic Properties of the Cloned Na+/Glucose Cotransporter: II.

To explore the possible role of this system in the physiological modulation of electrical and contractile activity, we have developed a mathematical model of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in which the TATS is described as a single compartment. The geometrical characteristics of the TATS, the biophysical characteristics of ion transporters and their distribution between surface and tubular membranes were based on available experimental data. Biophysically realistic values of mean access resistance to the tubular lumen and time constants for ion exchange with the bulk extracellular solution were included. The fraction of membrane in the TATS was set to 56%. The action potentials initiated in current-clamp mode are accompanied by transient K+ accumulation and transient Ca2+ depletion in the TATS lumen. The amplitude of these changes relative to external ion concentrations was studied at steady-state stimulation frequencies of 1-5Hz. Ca2+ depletion increased from 7 to 13.1% with stimulation frequency, while K+ accumulation decreased from 4.1 to 2.7%. These ionic changes (particularly Ca2+ depletion) implicated significant decrease of intracellular Ca2+ load at frequencies natural for rat heart.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n The functional role of cardiac T-tubules explored in a model of rat ventricular myocytes, Michal Pasek, Jiri Simurda, and Georges Christe, 2006, *Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A*, 81, 3029-3051.

The model reproduces frequency-dependent changes of action potential shape and intracellular ion concentrations and can replicate experimental data showing ion diffusion between the tubular lumen and external solution in guinea-pig myocytes. The model is stable at rest and during activity and returns to rested state after perturbation. Theoretical analysis and model simulations show that, due to tight electrical coupling, tubular and surface membranes behave as a homogeneous whole during voltage and current clamp (maximum difference 0.9 mV at peak tubular INa of -38 nA). However, during action potentials, restricted diffusion and ionic currents in TATS cause depletion of tubular Ca2+ and accumulation of tubular K+ (up to -19.8% and +3.4%, respectively, of bulk extracellular values, at 6 Hz). These changes, in turn, decrease ion fluxes across the TATS membrane and decrease sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load. Thus, the TATS plays a potentially important role in modulating the function of guinea-pig ventricular myocyte in physiological conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A model of the guinea-pig ventricular cardiac myocyte incorporating a transverse-axial tubular system, Michal Pasek, Jiri Simurda, Clive H.

To observe an overall oscillatory insulin profile it is necessary that the insulin secretion from individual beta-cells is synchronized within islets, and that the population of islets is also synchronized. We have recently developed a model in which pulsatile insulin secretion is produced as a result of calcium-driven electrical oscillations in combination with oscillations in glycolysis. We use this model to investigate possible mechanisms for intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization. We show that electrical coupling is sufficient to synchronize both electrical bursting activity and metabolic oscillations. We also demonstrate that islets can synchronize by mutually entraining each other by their effects on a simple model \"liver,\" which responds to the level of insulin secretion by adjusting the blood glucose concentration in an appropriate way. Since all islets are exposed to the blood, the distributed islet-liver system can synchronize the individual islet insulin oscillations. Thus, we demonstrate how intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization of insulin oscillations may be achieved.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the pathways described by the mathematical model. Extracellular glucose (Ge) enters the pancreatic beta-cell through GLUT-2 transporters in the plasma membrane, and is subsequently broken down through a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions in the glycolysis pathway. The metabolic products of the glycolysis pathway feed into the mitchondria, the site of aerobic respiration, where they are used to produce ATP. ATP represents the common substrate, linking the metabolic (glycolysis) and electrical (membrane potential) components of the mathematical model by regulating the flow of potassium ions through the K(ATP)-channels in the plasma membrane. In turn, these control regulate the membrane potential and calcium ion flow leading to insulin secretion. Insulin acts to lower the plasma glucose concentration though the functions of the liver (represented by a dashed line). |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nIntra- and inter-islet synchronization of metabolically driven insulin secretion, Morten Gram Pedersen, Richard Bertram, and Arthur Sherman, 2005,*Biophysical Journal*\n , 89, 107-119.

Using this model we show that many of the puzzling quantitative features of HIV infection can be explained simply. We also consider effects of AZT on viral growth and T-cell population dynamics. The model exhibits two steady states, an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected state, in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if N, the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T cell, is less a critical value, Ncrit, then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative orthant, and this state is stable. For N > Ncrit, the uninfected state is unstable, and the endemically infected state can be either stable, or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is stable, it is characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment of this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T cells, during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows exponentially, and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation the model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in the model. The model predicts that different viral strains, characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T cells, can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate depletion at different rates. Two versions of the model are studied. In one the source of T cells from precursors is constant, whereas in the other the source of T cells decreases with viral load, mimicking the infection and killing of T-cell precursors. The latter gives more realistic predictions than the model with a constant source.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model. |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDynamics of HIV infection of CD4+ T cells, Perelson, Kirschner, Boer, *Mathematical Biosciences*, 114, 81-125.

The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days.

As discovered in the mid 90s, the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling cascade is a major signaling pathway regulating bone remodeling. In this paper we study theoretically the functional implications of particular RANKL/OPG expression profiles on bone volume. For this purpose we formulate an extended bone-cell dynamics model describing functional behaviour of basic multicellular units (BMUs) responsible for bone resorption and formation. This model incorporates the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling together with the regulating action of TGF-beta on bone cells. The bone-cell population model employed here builds on the work of Lemaire et al. (2004) [1], but incorporates the following significant modifications: (i) addition of a rate equation describing changes in bone volume with time as the key 'output function' tracking functional behaviour of BMUs, (ii) a rate equation describing release of TGF-beta from the bone matrix, (iii) expression of OPG and RANKL on both osteoblastic cell lines, and (iv) modified activator/repressor functions. Using bone volume as a functional selection criterion, we find that there is a preferred arrangement for ligand expression on particular cell types, and further, that this arrangement coincides with biological observations. We then investigate the model parameter space combinatorially, searching for preferred 'groupings' of changes in differentiation rates of various cell types. Again, a criterion of bone volume change is employed to identify possible ways of optimally controlling BMU responses. While some combinations of changes in differentiation rates are clearly unrealistic, other combinations of changes in differentiation rates are potentially functionally significant. Most importantly, the combination of parameter changes representing the signaling pathway for TGF-beta gives a unique result that appears to have a clear biological rationale. The methodological approach for the investigation of model structure described here offers a theoretical explanation as to why TGF-beta has its particular suite of biological effects on bone-cell differentiation rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic illustration of bone-cell population model: (a) osteoblastic cell line and (b) osteoclastic cell lines taken into account together with RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (DOB, DOC...differentiation rates of osteoblasts and osteoclasts; EOB, EOC...elimination/apoptosis rates of osteoblasts and osteoclasts; RANKL binds to RANK and promotes differentiation of OCp; OPG binds to RANKL and so inhibits OCp differentiation). |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModel structure and control of bone remodeling: a theoretical study, Pivonka P, Zimak J, Smith DW, Gardiner BS, Dunstan CR, Sims NA, Martin TJ, Mundy GR, 2008, *Bone*, 43, 249-263.

Experimental evidence indicates that this phenomenon is due to the interaction of multiple conductances with very different kinetics, and the model incorporates this evidence. As a parameter is varied the model undergoes a transition between two oscillatory waveforms; a corresponding transition is observed experimentally. After establishing the periodicity of the subcritical oscillatory solution, the nature of the transition is studied. It is found to be a resonance bifurcation, with the solution branching at the critical point to another periodic solution of the same period. Using this result a comparison is made between the model and experimental observations.

This model recreates continuous PTH dosing model using low doses.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) kinetics, focusing on the receptor's response to PTH dosing to discern bone formation responses from bone resorption. The PTH1R is a major target for new osteoporosis treatments, as pulsatile PTH dosing has been shown to induce net bone formation in both animals and humans, and PTH(1-34) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. PTH has also been shown to cause net bone loss when given continuously, so that the net action of PTH on bone is dependent on the dosing pattern. We have developed a simplified two-state receptor kinetics model for the PTH1R, based on the concepts of Segel et al., to distinguish the activity of active and inactive receptor and receptor-ligand complexes. The goal is to develop a plausible model of the minimal essential biological relationships necessary for understanding the responses to PTH dosing. A two-state model is able to effectively discriminate between continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing using the active species as surrogates for the downstream anabolic response. For continuous PTH dosing, the model predicts a desensitized system dominated by the inactive receptor and complex, consistent with downstream net bone loss that has been demonstrated experimentally. Using pulsatile PTH dosing, the model system predicts a highly sensitized state dominated by the active receptor and complex, corresponding to net bone formation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinetics of the receptor plays a critical role in the downstream effects of PTH dosing. Moreover, these results indicate that within a range of biologically relevant PTH doses, the two-state model is able to capture the differential behavior of the system for both continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing. The development of such a model provides a rational basis for developing more biologically extensive models that may support the design of optimal dosing strategies for PTH-based anti-osteoporosis treatments. Moreover, this model provides a unique starting point from which to design experiments investigating PTH receptor biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the two-state model for PTHR1 binding kinetics PTH is secreted and/or dosed at a rate D and binds to the active (Ra) and inactive (Ri) forms of the receptor.

Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical androgenic and antiandrogenic compounds. A mathematical model for the dynamics of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson (1997). The model describes the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone (T), 5{alpha}-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and luteinizing hormone (LH), with metabolism of T to DHT by 5{alpha}-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by LH and negative regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes involved in prostate size and function include cell proliferation, apoptosis, fluid production, and 5{alpha}-reductase activity. Each process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for intact, castrated, and intravenous T-injected rats. After calibration, the model accurately captures the castration-induced regression of the prostate compared with experimental data that show that the prostate regresses to ~17 and 5% of its intact weight at 14 and 30 days postcastration, respectively. The model also accurately predicts serum T and AR levels following castration compared with data. This model provides a framework for quantifying the kinetics and effects of environmental and pharmaceutical endocrine active compounds on the prostate.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Model schema for testosterone (T) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) kinetics. Arrows represent blood flow between tissue compartments, substrate metabolism, and clearance (as labelled). T synthesis occurs in the blood and in testicular Leydig cells (LC), with androgen binding to albumin in the blood and to androgen receptor (AR) in the prostate. The testes compartment can be further broken down into spermatic cord venous blood (SV), testicular venous blood (TV), interstitial fluid (IF), and seminiferous tubules (ST). Androgenic regulation in the prostate is highlighted. T is converted to DHT, and either T or DHT can bind to the AR and form homogeneous or heterogeneous dimers (this diagram is only showing DHT binding, not T binding). AR-mediated DNA transcription leads to enhanced cell proliferation and conversion of T to DHT, and inhibition of cell apoptosis. |\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model for the androgenic regulation of the prostate in intact and castrated adult male rats, Laura K.

In the majority of these patients, sudden cardiac death is thought to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Alterations of the electric properties of single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present study, selected ionic currents based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action potential model developed by Luo and Rudy (LR model). The main results obtained from this model are as follows: The action potential in ventricular myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the slowed diastolic decay of the [Ca2+]i transient, and the reduction of the inwardly rectifying K+ current and the Na+-K+ pump current in myocytes of failing hearts. Furthermore, the fast and slow components of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr) and I(Ks), respectively) are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human ventricular action potential. In contrast, the influence of the transient outward K+ current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of I(Kr) promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in failing, but not nonfailing, myocytes. Furthermore, spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human ventricular myocardium.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSimulation study of cellular electric properties in heart failure, Leo Priebe and Dirk J.

They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent proteins, the re-folding of\ndenatured proteins, the prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and\nlysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced\ntranscription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock\nproteins resulting in feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to\nHSF, which is then able to become transcriptionally active.\n\n\n\n\n The induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant/damaged proteins\naccumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and\ncataract). Therefore, the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing.

The model also reproduces the repetitive firing properties seen in neonatal HMs and replicates the neuron's response to pharmacological experiments. The model was used to study the role of specific ionic currents in HM firing and how variations in the densities of these currents may account for age-dependent changes in excitability seen in HMs. By varying the density of a fast inactivating calcium current, the model alternates between accelerating and adapting firing patterns. Modeling the age-dependent increase in H current density accounts for the decrease in mAHP duration observed experimentally, but does not fully account for the decrease in input resistance. An increase in the density of the voltage-dependent potassium currents and the H current is required to account for the decrease in input resistance. These changes also account for the age-dependent decrease in action potential duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A schematic diagram of the cell model.

Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned, their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our previously developed pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and sparsely connected networks were explored for several levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with a low probability of bursting and low input and output ranges. The results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the network is greater than 20% of the population. Experimental tests of the model predictions are proposed.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the cell model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIntrinsic Bursters Increase the Robustness of Rythm Generation in an Excitatory Network, L.K.

Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDynamic rerouting of the carbohydrate flux is key to counteracting oxidative stress, Markus Ralser, Mirjam M Wamelink, Axel Kowald, Birgit Gerisch, Gino Heeren, Eduard A Struys, Edda Klipp, Cornelis Jakobs, Michael Breitenbach, Hans Lehrach and Sylvia Krobitsch, 2007, *Journal of Biology*, volume 6, 1-18.

To obtain insights into the ionic mechanisms governing canine atrial AP properties, we incorporated formulations of K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) currents, based on measurements in canine atrial myocytes, into a mathematical model of the AP. The rate-dependent behavior of model APs corresponded to experimental measurements and pointed to a central role for L-type Ca(2+) current inactivation in rate adaptation. Incorporating previously described regional ionic current variations into the model largely reproduced AP forms characteristic of the corresponding right atrial regions (appendage, pectinate muscle, crista terminalis, and atrioventricular ring). When ionic alterations induced by tachycardia-dependent remodeling were incorporated, the model reproduced qualitatively the AP features constituting the cellular substrate for atrial fibrillation. We conclude that this ionic model of the canine atrial AP agrees well with experimental measurements and gives potential insights into mechanisms underlying functionally important electrophysiological phenomena in canine atrium.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical analysis of canine atrial action potentials: rate, regional factors, and electrical remodeling, Rafael J.

Using these biochemical interactions, we develop a mathematical model of the NF-kappaB-mediated survival and caspase-mediated apoptosis pathways. Using mass action kinetics, we follow the formation of the survival and late complexes as well as the dynamics of DNA fragmentation. The effect of TNF-alpha concentration on DNA fragmentation is modeled and compares well with experiment. Nuclear transcription is also modeled phenomenologically by means of time lagged cytosolic concentrations. This results in transcription related concentrations undergoing under-damped oscillations, in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment. Using a tumor cell as a hypothetical model, we explore the interplay between the components of the survival and apoptotic pathways. Results are presented which make predictions on the limits of cellular oscillations in terms of time delay, initial concentration ratios and other features of the model. The model also makes clear predictions on cell viability in terms of DNA damage within the framework of TNF-alpha stimulus duration.\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\n Survival and Apoptotic Pathways Initiated by TNF-alpha: Modeling and Predictions.

Other factors can be added as the need arises. The model is aimed at simulating what happens in a single individual, but its parameters and variables were adjusted to the corresponding published average values. Simulations of published observations in humans undergoing the infusion of calcium or its chelators are presented. With a single exception, these simulations provided a good fit to the data. The response of the system to extrinsic perturbations was characterized by simulating chronic infusions of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol. Finally, the steady state response to perturbations in some of its parameters (the secretory mass of the parathyroids and the affinity and/or sensitivity of the calcium, PTH, and calcitriol receptors) and to renal failure were also investigated in an attempt to analyze the pathogenesis of clinical hypo- or hypercalcemias. In its present form the model cannot be used to base clinical decisions in individual cases. However, it requires modest computational resources, and clinicians with a modest mathematical background can manipulate it. It is a useful tool for the analysis of general mechanisms of the diseases of calcium metabolism and for the design of clinical experiments aimed at characterizing these diseases.

Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics, which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this nonlinear remodeling process. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram depicting the Rattanakul et al 2003 model - effects of PTH on osteoclast differentiation by osteoblasts. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling of bone formation and resorption mediated by parathyroid hormone: response to estrogen/PTH therapy, Chontita Rattanakul, Yongwimon Lenbury, Nateetip Krishnamara, and David J.

The method is based on representing force in a half sarcomere as the product of the stiffness of all parallel cross bridges and their average distortion. Differential equations for sarcomeric stiffness are derived from a three-state kinetic scheme for the cross-bridge cycle. Differential equations for average distortion are derived from a distortional balance that accounts for distortion entering and leaving due to cross-bridge cycling and for distortion imposed by shearing motion between thick and thin filaments. The distortion equations are unique and enable sarcomere mechanodynamics to be described by only a few ordinary differential equations. Model predictions of small-amplitude step and sinusoidal responses agreed well with previously described experimental results and allowed unique interpretations to be made of various response components. Similarly good results were obtained for model reproductions of force-velocity and large-amplitude step and ramp responses. The model allowed reasonable predictions of contractile behavior by taking into account what is understood to be basic muscle contractile mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of myofilament regulation and cross-bridge cycling giving rise to stiffness and distortion dynamics of sarcomere.

As described in the paper, this model simulates isometric conditions and has parameters for v,w, and u set to 1.

Ca activation is maximized, to mimic Table 2 in the paper. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: Cooperativity in contractile behavior of myofilament systems almost assuredly arises because of interactions between neighboring sites. These interactions may be of different kinds. Tropomyosin thin-filament regulatory units may have neighbors in steric blocking positions (off) or steric permissive positions (on). The position of these neighbors influence the tendency for the regulatory unit to assume the on or off state. Likewise, the tendency of a myosin cross-bridge to achieve a force-bearing state may be influenced by whether neighboring cross-bridges are in force-bearing states. Also, a cross-bridge in the force-bearing state may influence the tendency of a regulatory unit to enter the on state. We used a mathematical model to examine the influence of each of these three kinds of neighbor interactions on the steady-state force-pCa relation and on the dynamic force redevelopment process. Each neighbor interaction was unique in its effects on maximal Ca2+-activated force, position, and symmetry of the force-pCa curve and on the Hill coefficient. Also, each neighbor interaction had a distinctive effect on the time course of force development as assessed by its rate coefficient, kdev. These diverse effects suggest that variations in all three kinds of nearest-neighbor interactions may be responsible for a wide variety of currently unexplained observations of myofilament contractile behavior..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the Razumova et al model.

(2000), a mathematical model is developed for the methionine cycle. A large amount of information is available about the enzymes that catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine, and the removal of mass from the cycle by the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational \"experiments\" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A mathematical model of the methionine cycle, Michael C.

The underlying mechanism is based on direct negative regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by calcium/calmodulin and does not require any autocatalysis such as calcium-induced calcium release. The model is in quantitative agreement with available experimental data, both with respect to oscillations and to fast adaptation. We give predictions for the ranges of parameters in which oscillations should be observable.

Competitive binding and transport of NH+4 is included within this model.

Model calculations of metabolic acid-base disturbances are performed and comparison is made among antiporter representations (kinetic model, kinetic model without internal modifier, and NET formulation). It is found that the ability to sharply turn off Na+/H+ exchange in cellular alkalosis substantially eliminates the cell volume increase associated with high HCO3- conditions. In the tubule model, diminished Na+/H+ exchange in alkalosis blunts the axial decrease in luminal HCO3- and thus diminishes paracellular reabsorption of Cl-.

In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na- and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30-50 mV), and approached zero at -150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for aMDG-evoked outward current (K\\_0.5\\_aMDG) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, K\\_0.5\\_aMDG for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). K\\_0.5\\_Na was similar for forward and reverse transport (~ 35mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: aMDG (1.0) > D-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > D-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: aMDG ~ D-glucose ~ D-galactose > 3-O-methylglucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations. Our data indicate that under physiological conditions, the transporter is poised to accumulate sugar efficiently in the enterocyte.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n>\nKinetics of the Reverse Mode of the Na+Glucose Cotransporter, S.Eskandari, E.M.

This file is known to run in OpenCell to reproduce all panels in figure 2. The units have been checked and they are consistent. The initial conditions [x, y, z, v, w] can be altered to replicate the different panels [single infected system (a): x=200, y=0, z=0, v=10^-6, w=0], [system with double infection (b): x=3, y=6, z=0, v=149, w=1], [alternate system with double infection (c): same as b, but alpha=0.016], and current parameterization is set to replicate figure2b. Note that in the paper, the figure diagrams are scaled logarithmically. Note that the model also runs in COR, but due to the unit of time being days, the timescale is a problem for the CellML model simulation to recreate the published model results.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nABSTRACT: A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level.

Two phenomena that characterise these short-term I-F relations are restitution and postextrasystolic potentiation. In their 2000 paper, J. Jeremy Rice, M. Saleet Jafri and Raimond L. Winslow use two modelling approaches to study short-term interval-force relations in cardiac muscle. Their first approach employs a relatively simple (or minimal), discrete-time model of excitation-contraction coupling. This model explains restitution and postextrasystolic potentiation in terms of the total amount of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and a feature in which Ca2+ stored in the SR slowly becomes available for release into the sarcoplasm (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n\nIn their second modelling approach, J. Jeremy Rice, M. Saleet Jafri and Raimond L. Winslow develop a more detailed ventricular cell model that is able to simulate action potentials, Ca2+-handling mechanisms, and isometric force generation by the myofilaments. This single comprehensive (or maximal) model combines two previously developed models (see  [The Jafri-Rice-Winslow Ventricular Model, 1998](http://www.cellml.org/models/jafri_rice_winslow_1998_version03) and  [Cooperative Mechanisms in Cardiac Muscle, Rice *et al.*, 1999](http://www.cellml.org/models/rice_winslow_jafri_1999_version03)). The first ventricular cell model describes membrane currents and Ca2+-handling, and the second model of myofilaments provides the force generation of muscle contraction (see below). The ventricular cell model provides the Ca2+ needed to drive the myofilament contraction. This is a feedforward pathway in which Ca2+ binds to troponin and initiates force generation by triggering myofilament contraction. A feedback pathway also links the two models, as the affinity of troponin for Ca2+ is a function of developed force. \n\n\n\n\n[Modeling short-term interval-force relations in cardiac muscle](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/278/3/H913) J.

Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF response. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well-suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cystolic Ca transient.\n \n\n\n\nNote that the current CellMl model describes the rat model of myofilamentcontraction. One of the goals of the published work by Rice et al. was to develop a model of the myofilaments which could be coupled to existing models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. Similarly, it is our intention to be able to couple the CellML model of myofilament contration with cardiac models of electrophysiology and calcium change. To achieve this we will first have to modify the rat myofilament model to convert it to a rabbit myofilament model. This can be achieved by decreasing the transition rates in the crossbridge cycle by a factor of 5 to simulate the changes in myosin isoforms (rat is predominately V1 while rabbit is V3) and species-based changes in rate. We can then couple the model to the [Chicago rabbit ventricular myocyte model](http://www.cellml.org/models/shannon_wang_puglisi_weber_bers_2004_version04) by using the cytosolic Ca concentration ([Ca]c) from the Chicago model as the input to the myofilament model.

It has been suggested that hearts that have been mechanically compromised by congestive heart failure display an increased prevalence of arrhythmia. In addition, *in vitro* studies have shown that sudden cardiac tissue stretch can stimulate arrhythmias. One hypothesised mechanism for the stretch sensitivity of cardiac muscle is the presence of stretch-activated channels (SACs). \n\n\n\n\nIn their 1998 study, Riemer *et al.* investigate the potential role of SACs in excitability and arrhythmogenesis. To do this they added a linear, time-independent, stretch-sensitive current to the Luo-Rudy membrane model for guinea pig ventricular myocytes (see [Luo-Rudy I model](http://www.cellml.org/models/luo_rudy_1991_version04) and [Zeng *et al.* 1995 model](http://www.cellml.org/models/luo_rudy_1994_version02) for more details, and also see the figure below). Model simulations showed that increased stretch conductance led to resting potential depolarisation, a decreased excitation threshold, altered action potential duration, and, under certain conditions, early afterdepolarisations. From these results Riemer *et al.* concluded that stretch increases cellular excitability, making the heart prone to ectopic activity. Regional effects of stretch on action potential are influenced by factors such as the SAC reversal potential, ionic conditions and baseline refractoriness throughout the heart and therefore an increased risk of arrhythmia. \n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Stretch-induced changes in arrhythmogenesis and excitability in experimentally based heart cell models](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/275/2/H431), Tara L.

The ordered progression between these phases is achieved thanks to the existence of checkpoint mechanisms based on mutual inhibition of these processes. Here we study a simple theoretical model for oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2 activity, involving mutual inhibition of the two oscillators. Each minimal oscillator is described by a three-variable cascade involving a cdk, together with the associated cyclin and cyclin-degrading enzyme. The dynamics of this skeleton model of coupled oscillators is determined as a function of the strength of their mutual inhibition. The most common mode of dynamic behavior, obtained under conditions of strong mutual inhibition, is that of alternating oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2, which correspond to the physiological situation of the ordered recurrence of the M and S phases. In addition, for weaker inhibition we obtain evidence for a variety of dynamic phenomena such as complex periodic oscillations, chaos, and the coexistence between multiple periodic or chaotic attractors. We discuss the conditions of occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior, as well as their possible physiological significance.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\nAlternating Oscillations and Chaos in a Model of Two Coupled Biochemical Oscillators Driving Successive Phases of the Cell Cycle, Pierre-Charles Romond, Mauro Rustici, Didier Gonze, Albert GOldbeter, 1999, *Annals of the New York Acedemy of Sciences*, 879, 180-193.

Additionally, many patients experience transient episodes of viremia above the detection limit, termed viral blips, even after being on highly suppressive therapy for many years. An obstacle to viral eradication is the persistence of a latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. The mechanisms underlying low viral load persistence, slow decay of the latent reservoir, and intermittent viral blips are not fully characterized. The quantitative contributions of residual viral replication to viral and the latent reservoir persistence remain unclear. In this paper, we probe these issues by developing a mathematical model that considers latently infected cell activation in response to stochastic antigenic stimulation. We demonstrate that programmed expansion and contraction of latently infected cells upon immune activation can generate both low-level persistent viremia and intermittent viral blips. Also, a small fraction of activated T cells revert to latency, providing a potential to replenish the latent reservoir. By this means, occasional activation of latently infected cells can explain the variable decay characteristics of the latent reservoir observed in different clinical studies. Finally, we propose a phenomenological model that includes a logistic term representing homeostatic proliferation of latently infected cells. The model is simple but can robustly generate the multiphasic viral decline seen after initiation of therapy, as well as low-level persistent viremia and intermittent HIV-1 blips. Using these models, we provide a quantitative and integrated prospective into the long-term dynamics of HIV-1 and the latent reservoir in the setting of potent antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of the model with latently infected cell activation. |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling latently infected cell activation: viral and latent reservoir persistence, and viral blips in HIV-infected patients on potent therapy, Rong L, Perelson A, 2009, *PLoS Computational Biology*, 5, (issue 10): e1000533.

Stimulation of airway myocytes results in an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the subsequent activation of the contractile apparatus. Many contractile agonists, including acetylcholine, induce [Ca2+]i increase via Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through InsP3 receptors. Several models have been developed to explain the characteristics of InsP3-induced [Ca2+]i responses, in particular Ca2+ oscillations. The article reviews the modelling of the major structures implicated in intracellular Ca2+ handling, i.e., InsP3 receptors, SERCAs, mitochondria and Ca2+-binding cytosolic proteins. We developed theoretical models speci\ufb01cally dedicated to the airway myocyte which include the major mechanisms responsible for intracellular Ca2+ handling identi\ufb01ed in these cells. These biocomputations pointed out the importance of the relative proportion of InsP3 receptor isoforms and the respective role of the different mechanisms responsible for cytosolic Ca2+ clearance in the pattern of [Ca2+]i variations. We have developed a theoretical model of membrane conductances that predicts the variations in membrane potential and extracellular Ca2+ in\ufb02ux. Stimulation of this model by simulated increase in [Ca2+]i predicts membrane depolarisation, but not great enough to trigger a signi\ufb01cant opening of voltage-dependant Ca2+ channels. This may explain why airway contraction induced by cholinergic stimulation does not greatly depend on extracellular calcium. The development of such models of airway myocytes is important for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of airway reactivity and their possible modulation by pharmacological agents.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Modelling of calcium handling in airway myocytes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TBN-4GBWFDJ-2&_user=140507&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=fb58937e9ac3f82ee7e81e9b28c139de), Etienne Roux, Penelope J.

A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory-expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory-inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast-slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the 4-neuron core model of the brain stem respiratory network. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple rhythmic states in a model of the respiratory central pattern generator, Rubin JE, Shevtsova NA, Ermentrout GB, Smith JC, Rybak IA, 2009, *Journal of Neurophysiology*, 101, 2146-1265.

Principal components of muscular tension development are the proteins actin, myosin, troponin and tropomyosin. The tension is produced by cross-bridge cycling of actin and myosin using adenosine triphosphate as energy source. The cross-bridge cycling is initiated by binding of intracellular calcium to troponin, resulting in configuration changes of tropomyosin.\n\nIn this work a hybrid model of protein interactions in cardiac tension development is derived on basis of recent measurements and descriptions on protein level. Dependencies on intracellular calcium concentration, sarcomere stretch and stretch velocity as well as cooperativity mechanisms are incorporated. The model quantifies the tension development by states associated to configurations of the involved proteins. The model enables in conjunction with electrophysiological models of cardiac myocytes the reconstruction of electro-mechanical phenomena. Numerical simulations with the hybrid model were performed, which illustrated the reconstruction of steady state and length switches experiments.

The CVode integrator needs to be used in Jsim to run this model. The units have been checked and are consistent, and we would like to thank Frank Sachse, the original model author, for his advice and assistance in getting the CellML version of this model working.

They are arranged in the myocardium, as a three-dimensional network, where they are responsible for the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, and also play a role in cardiac electrophysiology. Although fibroblasts themselves are electrically in-excitable, they can contribute to the electrophysiology of neighbouring myocytes through fibroblast-myocyte coupling. Although the electrical coupling of fibroblasts and myocytes has been demonstrated experimentally both in vivo and in vitro, the precise role of fibroblasts as electrical bridges between myocytes still remains to be defined. \n\n\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Frank Sachse, Alonso Moreno and J. A. Abildskov address this issue by presenting mathematical models of cellular and multi-cellular electrophysiology. A novel mathematical model of cardiac fibroblasts was developed on the basis of experimental data from whole cell patch clamp and polymerase chain reaction studies. This model was then applied, together with models of ventricular myocytes (which were based on the [Pandit *et al.* 2001 model](http://www.cellml.org/models/pandit_clark_giles_demir_2001_version07) of the rat left ventricular myocyte), to determine the electrophysiological effects of heterogeneous electrical coupling of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the fibroblast cell model.

We find that the gating of RyR channels spontaneously shifts between high (H) and low (L) levels of activity and inactive periods where no channel openings are detected (I). Moreover, we find that there is evidence for multiple gating modes within H activity, which we term H1 and H2 mode. Our results demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms regulating gating are similar in native and purified channels. Dwell-time distributions of L activity were best fitted by three open and five closed significant exponential components whereas dwell-time distributions of H1 activity were best fitted by two to three open and four closed significant exponential components. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] cause an increase in open probability (Po) within L activity and an increase in the probability of occurrence of H activity. Open lifetime distributions within L activity were Ca2+ independent whereas open lifetime distributions within H activity were Ca2+ dependent. This study is the first attempt to estimate RyR single-channel kinetic parameters from sequences of idealized dwell-times and to develop kinetic models of RyR gating using the criterion of maximum likelihood. We propose distinct kinetic schemes for L, H1, and H2 activity that describe the major features of sheep cardiac RyR channel gating at these levels of activity.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMarkovian Models Of Low And High Activity Levels Of Cardiac Ryanodine Receptors, Elena Saftenku, Alan J.

The model successfully reconstructs the experimental action potentials at various concentrations of external Ca2+ and K+. Increasing the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ current (I(CaL)) prolongs the duration of the action potential and thereby slightly decreases the spontaneous rate. On the other hand, a negative voltage shift of I(CaL) gating by a few mV markedly increases the spontaneous rate. When the amplitude of sustained inward current (I(st)) is increased, the spontaneous rate is increased irrespective of the I(CaL) amplitude. Increasing [Ca2+](o) shortens the action potential and increases the spontaneous rate. When the spontaneous activity is stopped by decreasing I(CaL) amplitude, the resting potential is nearly constant (-35 mV) over 1-15 mM [K+](o) as observed in the experiment. This is because the conductance of the inward background non-selective cation current balances with the outward [K+](o)-dependent K+ conductance. The unique role of individual voltage- and time-dependent ion channels is clearly demonstrated and distinguished from that of the background current by calculating an instantaneous zero current potential (\"lead potential\") during the course of the spontaneous activity. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRole of Individual Ionic Current Systems in the SA Node Hypothesized by a Model Study, Sarai N, Matsuoka S, Kuratomi S, Ono K, and Noma A, 2003, *The Japanese Journal of Physiology*, 53, 125-134.

Much of this time and money is spent on experiments and drugs that fail. There is very little mechanistic understanding as to how the various levels of biological complexity - from molecular interactions, to cellular function, to tissue organisation, to whole organs and beyond - are integrated. Hierarchical mathematical models provide a method for integrating this data. Specifically, in the model described here, Sarkar and Lauffenburger focus on the case of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF).\n\n\n\n\nGCSF is of great clinical importance, especially for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The drug is injected into the blood stream where it then diffuses to the bone marrow and binds to its receptor GCSFR on precursor cells, inducing them to replicate and differentiate into mature neutrophils. In this way, the neutrophil count of immunocompromised patients is significantly increased. However, the bone marrow precursor cells engulf and degrade the GCSF, a negative feedback mechanism that reduces its potency. In addition, mature bone cells express the receptor GCSFR, and they bind, engulf and degrade the drug from the bloodstream. Thus, there is a significant negative feedback loop that reduces the lifetime of the drug.\n\n\n\n\nThe mathematical model developed by Sarkar and Lauffenburger relates extracellular GCSF depletion to the molecular properties of the ligand and the cells expressing the GCSF receptor (see the figure below). The authors then further integrated this cell-level model into a physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Cell-Level Pharmacokinetic Model of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor: Implications for Ligand Lifetime and Potency in Vivo](http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/1/147), Casim A.

We used systems analysis to investigate how the components and topology of this signaling network permit neurohormonal control of excitation-contraction coupling in the rat ventricular myocyte. A kinetic model integrating beta-adrenergic signaling with excitation-contraction coupling was formulated, and each subsystem was validated with independent biochemical and physiological measurements. Model analysis was used to investigate quantitatively the effects of specific molecular perturbations. 3-Fold overexpression of adenylyl cyclase in the model allowed an 85% higher rate of cyclic AMP synthesis than an equivalent overexpression of beta 1-adrenergic receptor, and manipulating the affinity of Gs alpha for adenylyl cyclase was a more potent regulator of cyclic AMP production. The model predicted that less than 40% of adenylyl cyclase molecules may be stimulated under maximal receptor activation, and an experimental protocol is suggested for validating this prediction. The model also predicted that the endogenous heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor may enhance basal cyclic AMP buffering by 68% and increasing the apparent Hill coefficient of protein kinase A activation from 1.0 to 2.0. Finally, phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban were found sufficient to predict the dominant changes in myocyte contractility, including a 2.6x increase in systolic calcium (inotropy) and a 28% decrease in calcium half-relaxation time (lusitropy). By performing systems analysis, the consequences of molecular perturbations in the beta-adrenergic signaling network may be understood within the context of integrative cellular physiology.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nModeling beta-adrenergic control of cardiac myocyte contractility *in silico*\n , Jeffrey J.

By transducing a range of environmental cues such as hormones and neurotransmitters, they coordinate many of the physiologicval reposnses to changes in the cell environment. In comparision with metabolism, signalling networks are poorly characterised. They account for a large portion of biological complexity, and understanding the function of these complex signalling networks presents a challenge to modern biology, requiring a combined approach of experimental analysis and modelling. \n\n\n\n\nSystems models of cell signalling can be considered at two levels of detail: abstract top-down models and mechansistic systems analyses. Top-down modelling, often based on protein interaction data, is useful for elucidating qualitative, topological features of signalling networks. Mechanistic systems models usually describe the biochemical reactions with kinetic rate laws and differential equations. There are several different approaches for devloping mechanistic systems models of signal transduction. These different methods are reviewed by Saucerman and McCulloch in the 2004 publication described here. As a case study of model devlopment and analysis, they examine the funcyional roles of phospholamban, the L-type calcium channel, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin I phosphorylation upon beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat ventricular myocyte (see the figure below). \n\n\n\n\nModel analysis revealed that although protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor greatly increases its calcium sensitivity, calcium autoregulation may adapt quickly be negating potential increases in contractility. The authors concluded that phospholamban phosphorylation is the main mechanism for increased sarcoplasmic reticulum load and calcium relaxation rate during beta-adrenergic stimulation, whereas both phospholamban and the L-type calcium channle contribute to increased systolic calcium.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Mechanistic systems models of cell signalling networks: a case study of nyocyte adrenergic regulation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TBN-4BT7D69-1&_user=140507&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2004&_alid=185464983&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=5147&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=5b437e8da921cae465fe5ea35228a7cc), Jeffrey J.

The endocrine system is largely self-regulating, compensating for moderate changes in dietary phytoestrogens (e.g., in soy products) and normal variations in physiology. However, severe changes in dietary or oral exposures or in health status (e.g., anorexia) , can completely disrupt the menstrual cycle in women. Thus, risk assessment tools should account for normal regulation and its limits. We present a mathematical model for the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women as a function of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin blood levels. The model reproduces the time courses of LH and FSH during the menstrual cycle and correctly predicts observed effects of administered estrogen and progesterone on LH and FSH during clinical studies. The model should be useful for predicting effects of hormonally active substances, both in the pharmaceutical sciences and in toxicology and risk assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the mathematical model of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and release.

In particular, to recreate the published results found in most of the paper, Ca(2+) concentration was modeled as an explicit function of time, and graphed on a log scale. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: A stretch-induced increase of active tension is one of the most important properties of the heart, known as the Frank-Starling law. Although a variation of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity with sarcomere length (SL) change was found to be involved, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully clarified. Some recent experimental studies indicate that a reduction of the lattice spacing between thin and thick filaments, through the increase of passive tension caused by the sarcomeric protein titin with an increase in SL within the physiological range, promotes formation of force-generating crossbridges (Xbs). However, the mechanism by which the Xb concentration determines the degree of cooperativity for a given SL has so far evaded experimental elucidation. In this simulation study, a novel, rather simple molecular-based cardiac contraction model, appropriate for integration into a ventricular cell model, was designed, being the first model to introduce experimental data on titin-based radial tension to account for the SL-dependent modulation of the interfilament lattice spacing and to include a conformational change of troponin I (TnI). Simulation results for the isometric twitch contraction time course, the length-tension and the force-[Ca(2+)] relationships are comparable to experimental data. A complete potential Frank-Starling mechanism was analyzed by this simulation study. The SL-dependent modulation of the myosin binding rate through titin's passive tension determines the Xb concentration which then alters the degree of positive cooperativity affecting the rate of the TnI conformation change and causing the Hill coefficient to be SL-dependent.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanism of the Frank-Starling law-- A simulation study with a novel cardiac muscle contraction model that includes titin and tropomyosin, Natalie S.

The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order.

A novel mechanistic model of postreceptor events including phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequent activation of downstream kinases Akt and protein kinase C-zeta is coupled with previously validated subsystem models of insulin receptor binding, receptor recycling, and GLUT4 translocation. A system of differential equations is defined by the structure of the model. Rate constants and model parameters are constrained by published experimental data. Model simulations of insulin dose-response experiments agree with published experimental data and also generate expected qualitative behaviors such as sequential signal amplification and increased sensitivity of downstream components. We examined the consequences of incorporating feedback pathways as well as representing pathological conditions, such as increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to illustrate the utility of our model for exploring molecular mechanisms.

The objective was to develop a model that: 1), accurately reflects Ca-dependent Ca release; 2), uses realistic parameters, particularly those that concern Ca transport from the cytosol; 3), comes to steady state; 4), simulates basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; and 5), runs on a normal desktop computer. The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na]i dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca]i; and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy. A particular emphasis is placed upon reproducing the nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca release upon SR Ca load. We conclude that this model is more robust than many previously existing models and reproduces many experimental results using parameters based largely on experimental measurements in myocytes. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical treatment of integrated Ca dynamics within the ventricular myocyte, Thomas R.

Pinpointing cardiovascular system dysfunction is often difficult because the clinical signs, or the availability and interpretation of physiological measurements, are unreliable. Often patient-specific information is incomplete or confusing, as it comes from a diverse range of sources, such as invasive and non-invasive pressure measurements, flow rates and electrocardiogram signals. Health professionals therefore rely on intuition and experience to make a \"clinical\" diagnosis and decide treatment. Sometimes this approach results in multiple therapies being applied until a suitable treatment is found. Poor outcomes result from failure to quickly and correctly diagnose and treat the underlying condition. We introduce the concept of using full circulatory and cardiovascular models to aggregate the large number of diverse signals facing clinicians into a clear physiological picture of haemodynamic status. We briefly review the field, still in its infancy, of such models, focusing primarily on the basic approaches taken in the literature. Finally, we present one of the more advanced and best validated models, including initial results of animal validation studies. The overall approach is shown to have significant potential to provide clear, measured insight to replace often misled intuition in the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of circulatory dysfunction in critical care. In the future, models and modern sensors will increasingly \"invade\" the critical care environment, and will provide the opportunity for better, more consistent care at the bedside in real time. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the Cardiovascular System, Geoffrey M Shaw, J Geoffrey Chase, Christina Starfinger, Bram W Smith, Christopher E Hann, Thomas Desaive, Alexandre Ghuysen, 2007, *Critical Care and Resuscitation*, 9, 264-269.

METHODS: Using an ionic-based theoretical model of the cardiac ventricular cell, the dynamic LRd model, we have simulated the three major component conditions of acute ischemia (elevated [K]o, acidosis and anoxia) at the level of individual ionic currents and ionic concentrations. The conditions were applied individually and in combination to identify ionic mechanisms responsible for reduced excitability at rest potentials, delayed recovery of excitability, and shortened action potential duration. RESULTS: Increased extracellular potassium ([K]o) had the major effect on cell excitability by depolarizing resting membrane potential (Vrest), causing reduction in sodium channel availability. Acidosis caused a [K]o-independent reduction in maximum upstroke velocity, (dVm/dt)max. A transition from sodium-current dominated to calcium-current dominated upstroke occurred, and calcium current alone was able to sustain the upstroke, but only after sodium channels were almost completely (97%) inactivated. Acidic conditions prevented the transition to calcium dominated upstroke by acidic reduction of both sodium and calcium currents. Anoxia, simulated by lowering [ATP]i and activating the APT-dependent potassium current, IK(ATP), was the only process that could decrease action potential duration by more than 50% and reproduce AP shape changes that are observed experimentally. Acidic or anoxic depression of the L-type calcium current could not reproduce the observed action potential shape changes and APD shortening. Delayed recovery of excitability, known as 'post-repolarization refractoriness', was determined by the voltage-dependent kinetics of sodium channel recovery; Vrest depolarization caused by elevated [K]o increased the time constant of (dVm/dt)max recovery from tau = 10.3 ms at [K]o = 4.5 mM to tau = 81.4 ms at [K]o = 12 mM, reflecting major slowing of sodium-channel recovery. Anoxia and acidosis had little affect on tau. CONCLUSIONS: The major conditions of acute ischemia, namely elevated [K]o, acidosis and anoxia, applied at the ionic channel level are sufficient to simulate the major electrical changes associated with ischemia. Depression of membrane excitability and delayed recovery of excitability in the single, unloaded cell are caused by elevated [K]o with additional excitability depression by acidosis. Major changes in action potential duration and shape can only be accounted for by anoxia-dependent opening of IK(ATP).\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nElectrophysiological effects of acute myocardial ischemia: a theoretical study of altered cell excitability and action potential duration, Robin M.

These receptors are close to the L-type calcium channels in the cell surface membrane, and when the cell is depolarised, the calcium that enters the cell through the L-type channels is confined within a microdomain (the dyadic junction). The RyR then sense this increase in [Ca2+]i and respond by opening and releasing more calcium from the SR in a process known as calcium-induced calcium releases (CICR). The cell's contractile elements are activated by this increase in [Ca2+]i and the cell contracts. A calcium-activated uptake pump then pumps calcium back into the SR. This interaction between membrane potential and intracellular calcium cycling forms the basis of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The calcium system is driven by an action potential waveform that is itself dependent on the dynamics of the calcium system.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been several efforts to mathematically model intracellular calcium dynamics, such as:\n\n\n\n* [Modelling the Functional Ca2+ Release Unit, 1999, Rice *et al.*, 1999](http://www.cellml.org/models/rice_jafri_winslow_2000_version02)\n* [Model of Ryanodine Receptor Gating in Cardiac Muscle, 1999, Stern *et al.*](http://www.cellml.org/models/stern_song_sham_yang_boheler_rios_1999_version02)\n* [Sobie *et al.* Mechanism of Cardiac Ca2+ Spark Termination, 2002](http://www.cellml.org/models/sobie_dilly_dossantoscruz_lederer_jafri_2002_version01)\n\n\n\nwhich focus on the detailed calcium dynamics within the dyadic junction. Several authors have developed models of calcium cycling at the whole cell level, including:\n\n\n\n* [Luo-Rudy Ventricular Model II (dynamic), 1994](http://www.cellml.org/models/luo_rudy_1994_version02)\n* [Jafri-Rice-Winslow Ventricular Model, 1998](http://www.cellml.org/models/jafri_rice_winslow_1998_version03)\n* [Snyder *et al.*, Cardiocyte Ca2+ Dynamics, 2000](http://www.cellml.org/models/snyder_palmer_moore_2000_version01)\n\n\nHowever, some of these models are lacking in physiological detail; for example, some ignore intracellular calcium compartmentation, or they overlook the fact that calcium release from the SR is in fact the summation of several discrete events.\n\n\n\n\nIn the publication described here, Shiferaw *et al.* present a new model of EC coupling in ventricular myocytes (see \n the figure\n below). In contrast to the previously published models this one represents calcium release from the SR as a summation of elementary release events that correspond to calcium sparks. In addition, the model includes features that are absent in the earlier models, such as:\n\n\n\n* a description of intracellular sodium accumulation;\n* compartmentation of myoplasm into a submembrane space near the sarcolemma, and the rest of the myoplasm; and\n* a calcium diffusional delay between the network SR (NSR) and the junctional SR (JSR)\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModel of Intracellular Calcium Cycling in Ventricular Myocytes, Y.

Pituitary corticotroph cells generate repetitive action potentials and associated Ca2+ transients in response to the agonist CRH. The mechanisms underlying this process are complex. CRH is known to activate the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. PKA phosphorylates L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, activating them and contributing to the generation of an action potential and Ca2+ transients. \n\n\n\n\nIn an earlier Hodgkin-Huxley type mathematical model of this process, LeBeau *et al.* showed than an increase in the L-type current was sufficient to generate repetitive action potentials from a resting state in the model (LeBeau *et al.*, 1997). However, they found that the action potential frequency of the model was much higher than the observed experimental action potential frequency. This problem was addressed in the current model described here (the complete original paper reference is cited below). \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the activation of the L-type current, CRH also inhibits an inwardly rectifying K+ current. This current helps to maintain a negative membrane resting potential. Inhibition of this inward rectifying K+ current enhances membrane depolarisation and increases membrane excitability. By adding a component that represents the inward rectifying K+ current to the original model, the new model simulates the dual modulatory action of CRH on inward rectifier and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels better describes the experimentally observed CHR-induced effects (see the figure below). \n\n\n\n\n[CRH-induced Electrical Activity and Calcium Signalling in Pituitary Corticotrophs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMD-45CWWS4-26&_user=140507&_coverDate=10%2F07%2F2000&_alid=68313992&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6932&_sort=d&_docanchor=&wchp=dGLbVzb-lSztz&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=08c1a4ab23ba3610c703cc5ce5ee4944), Paul R.

The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\nNonlinearities make a difference: comparison of two common Hill-type models with real muscle, Tobias Siebert, Christian Rode, Walter Herzog, Olaf Till and Reinhard Blickhan, 2008, *Biological Cybernetics*, 98, 133-143.

In order to fully reproduce the results of the original published model we need to duplicate each neuron 50 times to represent a population of cells. We also need to introduce heterogeneity between cells to make the model physiologically realistic. This heterogeneity can be introduced by randomly sampling certain parameter values from a population. In addition, initial conditions for each variable should be randomly chosen from a uniform distribution. Finally, the published model descibes three oscillatory mechanisms; namely the three-phase, two-phase, and one-phase rhythms. The CellML model described here represents the two-phase rhythm. Equations for gsynE and gsynI will have to be adjusted to produce the one-, and three-phase rhythms.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: Mammalian central pattern generators (CPGs) producing rhythmic movements exhibit extremely robust and flexible behavior. Network architectures that enable these features are not well understood. Here we studied organization of the brain stem respiratory CPG. By sequential rostral to caudal transections through the pontine-medullary respiratory network within an in situ perfused rat brain stem-spinal cord preparation, we showed that network dynamics reorganized and new rhythmogenic mechanisms emerged. The normal three-phase respiratory rhythm transformed to a two-phase and then to a one-phase rhythm as the network was reduced. Expression of the three-phase rhythm required the presence of the pons, generation of the two-phase rhythm depended on the integrity of Botzinger and pre-Botzinger complexes and interactions between them, and the one-phase rhythm was generated within the pre-Botzinger complex. Transformation from the three-phase to a two-phase pattern also occurred in intact preparations when chloride-mediated synaptic inhibition was reduced. In contrast to the three-phase and two-phase rhythms, the one-phase rhythm was abolished by blockade of persistent sodium current (I(NaP)). A model of the respiratory network was developed to reproduce and explain these observations. The model incorporated interacting populations of respiratory neurons within spatially organized brain stem compartments. Our simulations reproduced the respiratory patterns recorded from intact and sequentially reduced preparations. Our results suggest that the three-phase and two-phase rhythms involve inhibitory network interactions, whereas the one-phase rhythm depends on I(NaP). We conclude that the respiratory network has rhythmogenic capabilities at multiple levels of network organization, allowing expression of motor patterns specific for various physiological and pathophysiological respiratory behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic of the computational model of the brain stem respiratory network.

However, the CellML model will only simulate 14 heart beats, because if statements (piecewise equations) were used instead of a remainder operator to cycle the heart beat, but this number of beats can be increased if desired. \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nAbstract: Characterising circulatory dysfunction and choosing a suitable treatment is often difficult and time consuming, and can result in a deterioration in patient condition, or unsuitable therapy choices. A stable minimal model of the human cardiovascular system (CVS) is developed with the ultimate specific aim of assisting medical staff for rapid, on site modelling to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Models found in the literature simulate specific areas of the CVS with limited direct usefulness to medical staff. Others model the full CVS as a closed loop system, but they were found to be very complex, difficult to solve, or unstable. This paper develops a model that uses a minimal number of governing equations with the primary goal of accurately capturing trends in the CVS dynamics in a simple, easily solved, robust model. The model is shown to have long term stability and consistency with non-specific initial conditions as a result. An \"open on pressure close on flow\" valve law is created to capture the effects of inertia and the resulting dynamics of blood flow through the cardiac valves. An accurate, stable solution is performed using a method that varies the number of states in the model depending on the specific phase of the cardiac cycle, better matching the real physiological conditions. Examples of results include a 9% drop in cardiac output when increasing the thoracic pressure from -4 to 0 mmHg, and an increase in blood pressure from 120/80 to 165/130 mmHg when the systemic resistance is doubled. These results show that the model adequately provides appropriate magnitudes and trends that are in agreement with existing data for a variety of physiologically verified test cases simulating human CVS function. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMinimal haemodynamic system model including ventricular interaction and valve dynamics, Bram W Smith, J Geoffrey Chase, Roger I Nokes, Geoffrey M Shaw, Graeme Wake, 2004, *Medical Engineering and Physics*, 26, 131-139.

A lumping scheme is presented which exploits the differences in timescales associated with fast and slow transitions between model states, while maintaining the thermodynamic properties of the model. The goal of this approach is to contribute to modelling of the effects of disturbances to metabolism, associated with ischaemic heart disease, on cardiac cell function. The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Lauger and Apell, Eur. Biophys. J. 13 (1986) 309, for which the principles of free energy transduction are used to link the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis (deltaGATP) to the transition rates between states of the model. An iterative minimisation algorithm is implemented to determine the transition rate parameters based on the model fit to experimental data. Finally, the relationship between deltaGATP and pump cycling direction is investigated and compared with recent experimental findings.\n\n\n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of models of active ion transport for whole-cell modelling: cardiac sodium-potassium pump as a case study, N.

We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca(2+) binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca(2+) decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca(2+)-induced receptor activation increases with Ca(2+) and is faster than Ca(2+)-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca(2+) even when IP(3) is bound.

In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca(2+) entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca(2+) entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca(2+) entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca(2+) in the cell (the Ca(2+) load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca(2+) load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca(2+) influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca(2+) load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca(2+). \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nControl of calcium oscillations by membrane fluxes, J.

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater.

In this study, cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics were modeled using a set of six differential equations that were based on theories, equations, and parameters described in previous studies. Among the unique features of the model was the inclusion of bidirectional modulatory interplay between the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) release channel (SRRC) and calsequestrin (CSQ) in the SR lumen, where CSQ acted as a dynamic rather than simple Ca(2+) buffer, and acted as a Ca(2+) sensor in the SR lumen as well. The inclusion of this control mechanism was central in overcoming a number of assumptions that would otherwise have to be made about SRRC kinetics, SR Ca(2+) release rates, and SR Ca(2+) release termination when the SR lumen is assumed to act as a simple, buffered Ca(2+) sink. The model was sufficient to reproduce a graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) response, CICR with high gain, and a system with reasonable stability. As constructed, the model successfully replicated the results of several previously published experiments that dealt with the Ca(2+) dependence of the SRRC (, J. Gen. Physiol. 85:247-289), the refractoriness of the SRRC (, Am. J. Physiol. 270:C148-C159), the SR Ca(2+) load dependence of SR Ca(2+) release (, Am. J. Physiol. 268:C1313-C1329;, J. Biol.

J. 73:1524-1531), and a variety of contraction frequency-dependent alterations in sarcoplasmic [Ca(2+)] dynamics that are normally observed in the laboratory, including rest potentiation, a negative frequency-[Ca(2+)] relationship, and extrasystolic potentiation. Furthermore, under the condition of a simulated Ca(2+) overload, an alternans-like state was produced. In summary, the current model of cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics provides an integrated theoretical framework of fundamental cellular Ca(2+) regulatory processes that is sufficient to predict a broad array of observable experimental outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Mathematical Model of Cardiocyte Ca2+ Dynamics with a Novel Representation of Sarcoplasmic Reticular Ca2+ Control, Steven M.

A ternary positive feedback loop with only positive regulations is constructed with elements that activates the subsequent element in a clockwise fashion. A ternary negative feedback loop with only negative regulations is constructed with the elements that inhibit the subsequent element in an anticlockwise fashion. Positive feedback loop exhibits bistability, whereas the negative feedback loop exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The novelty of the topology is that the corresponding elements in these two homogeneous feedback loops are linked by the binary positive feedback loops with only positive regulations. This results in the emergence of mixed feedback loops in the network that displays complex behaviour like the coexistence of multiple steady states, relaxation oscillations and chaos. Importantly, the arrangement of the feedback loops brings in the notion of checkpoint in the model. The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates ternary positive feedback loop, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\nA minimal mathematical model combining several regulatory cycles from the budding yeast cell cycle, K.

Once the model author loads the original model onto their website ([found here](http://sleep.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty/225/klerman)) we'll check the CellML code against this original version and will hopefully be able to fix the CellML model.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nSince it is impossible to directly measure the activity of the circadian pacemaker in humans, alternative markers of the circadian rhythms must be used, such as plasma melatonin, core body temperature and cortisol levels. Of these markers, it has been demonstrated that plasma melatonin is the most reliable, and its presence in both blood and saliva makes it more accessible for assay. Furthermore, unlike cortisol melatonin is relatively unaffected by sleep-wake state.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral mathematical models of circadian rhythms have been developed based on plasma melatonin data. These employ a number of different methods to estimate circadian phase and amplitude from the measured melatonin data. However, the accuracy of these methods comes into question since melatonin levels can be subject to inter-individual variation and can also be influenced by environmental factors - especially light. Furthermore, the underlying physiology of melatonin secretion and clearance is often ignored.\n\n\n\n\nIn the study described here, Melissa St Hilaire *et al.* address these issues by developing a physiologically based mathematical model of melatonin, including ocular light suppression and interactions with the circadian pacemaker. Their model is an extension of the previously published model of melatonin rhythms by Brown *et al.* (also described in CellML). A saliva component has been added, and the effect of light on melatonin levels has been incorporated into the model by including equations based on those published by Kronauer *et al.*. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the components and variables in a mathematical model of human melatonin. Melatonin is synthesised in the pineal gland where its precursor tryptophan is converted to serotonin, and then to melatonin. The rate determining step in this synthesis pathway is the governed by the activity of N-acetylserotonin (NAT) (here represented by A), and the activity of this enzyme is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, the main mammalian circadian pacemaker.

Mitogenesis is initiated when growth factors bind to specific receptor-kinases on the cell surface, triggering a signal transduction pathway involving reversible protein phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases. \n\n\n\n\nIn this 1990 study, Starbuck *et al.* propose that growth factor receptors are responsible for triggering the signal transduction cascade by receiving an extracellular signal (the specific growth factor molecules), and converting this stimulus into the cascade via activation of the receptor kinase and subsequent protein phosphorylation and activation. In addition, the receptor kinase is also able to phosphorylate other key proteins in the signal pathway. The authors argue that a quantitative understanding of the receptor dynamics is essential for the understanding of the control of mammalian cell growth. \n\n\n\n\nTo this end they develop a mathematical model of epidermal growth factor binding and trafficking dynamics in fibroblasts. The figure below illustrates the surface and intracellular events which are included in the mathematical model. The ligand (Lo) binds to its receptor on the cell surface (Rs) to form a ligand-receptor complex (Cs). One of two possible pathways can then be taken:\n\n\n* In the first pathway, the ligand-receptor complex migrates in the plane of the cell surface membrane to cluster in specialised regions of the membrane called clathrin-coated pits. Here, the complexes bind to the coated-pit proteins (Ps) to form ternary complexes (Ts), which are then internalised (Ti).\n* In the second pathway, the ligand-receptor complex is internalised as it is, without forming a ternary complex with pit-proteins (Cic).\n\n\nAfter ternary complexes are internalised, the acidic environment of the endosome enhances receptor-ligand dissociation, firstly to form free complexes (Cii) and then further degradation to form free receptors (Rii) and free ligand (Lii). If Rii and/or Cii migrate into the endosomal tubules, they get recycled back to the cell surface membrane for further binding and trafficking. The fate of receptors (Ric) and complexes (Cic) from the smooth pit pathway is not as well understood, but recycling is also assumed to occur. \n\n\n\nThe mathematical model to describe this process consists of a series of kinetic equations which describe the binding, internalisation and recycling of epidermal growth factor and its receptor, together with a simple expression which relates the dependence of the cell cycle progression on the receptor dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Epidermal Growth Factor Binding and Trafficking Dynamics in Fibroblasts: Relationship to Cell Proliferation](http://80-www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TFK-445B4R7-FV&_user=140507&_handle=W-WA-A-A-AUD-MsSAYZA-UUW-AUDUWZABEZ-AWCBCDUCC-AUD-U&_fmt=summary&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1990&_rdoc=49&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%235229%231990%23999549991%23267397!&_cdi=5229&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=445333becab508555d71f60eace03d96), Cindy Starbuck, H.

The current model only describes a single RyR gating scheme, while the paper tests different gating schemes coupled with other dyadic components to recreate ion flows. As these are not described in great depth, this model is likely to remain incomplete and unable to recreate published results. Initial conditions used here are guesses. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: In cardiac muscle, release of activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs by calcium-induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are clustered in a dense, regular, two-dimensional lattice array at the diad junction. We simulated numerically the stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four putative RyR gating schemes based on single-channel measurements in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation-contraction coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background calcium. If the ryanodine receptor was represented, instead, by a phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting from simultaneous binding of two Ca2+ ions, and either calcium-dependent or activation-linked inactivation, the simulations gave a good semiquantitative accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation-contraction coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of the foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation during evolution.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nLocal Control Models of Cardiac Excitation-Contraction Coupling *A Possible Role for Allosteric Interactions between Ryanodine Receptors*, Michael D.

Positive feedbacks are created by Cdc13/Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of specific substrates: inactivating its negative regulators (Rum1, Ste9 and Wee1/Mik1) and activating its positive regulator (Cdc25). A slow negative feedback loop is turned on during mitosis by activation of Slp1/anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which indirectly re-activates the negative regulators, leading to a drop in Cdc13/Cdc2 activity and exit from mitosis.\n \n\n\nThe model explains how fission yeast cells can exit mitosis in the absence of Ste9 (Cdc13 degradation) and Rum1 (an inhibitor of Cdc13/Cdc2). We also show that, if the positive feedback loops accelerating the G2/M transition (through Wee1 and Cdc25) are weak, then cells can reset back to G2 from early stages of mitosis by premature activation of the negative feedback loop. This resetting can happen more than once, resulting in a quantized distribution of cycle times, as observed experimentally in wee1 - cdc25delta mutant cells. Our quantitative description of these quantized cycles demonstrates the utility of mathematical modeling, because these cycles cannot be understood by intuitive arguments alone.\n \n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n[Modeling the fission yeast cell cycle: Quantized cycle\ntimes in wee12- cdc25 mutant cells](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/14/7865.abstract), Akos Sveiczer, Attila Csikasz-Nagi, Bela Gyorffy, John J.

This is the mean field model with synaptic depression, and is only one of the five models described in the paper. However, the others describe networks of 100 linked cells, which is a simulation not inside the current scope of CellML. This model also features elements unsuitable to CellML, the variable \"noise\" is defined as an array of values around zero with a normal distribution, but it is simply set to zero for this simulation. This model comes close to reproducing figures 7A and 7B, although the slight oscillation in these figures arising from the variable \"noise\" is not present. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Spontaneous episodic activity is a fundamental mode of operation of developing networks. Surprisingly, the duration of an episode of activity correlates with the length of the silent interval that precedes it, but not with the interval that follows. Here we use a modeling approach to explain this characteristic but so far unexplained feature of developing networks. Because the correlation pattern is observed in networks with different structures and components, a satisfactory model needs to generate the right pattern of activity regardless of the details of network architecture or individual cell properties. We thus developed simple models incorporating excitatory coupling between heterogeneous neurons and activity-dependent synaptic depression. These models robustly generated episodic activity with the correct correlation pattern. The correlation pattern resulted from episodes being triggered at random levels of recovery from depression while they terminated around the same level of depression. To explain this fundamental difference between episode onset and termination, we then used a mean field model, where only average activity and average level of recovery from synaptic depression are considered. In this model, episode onset is highly sensitive to inputs. Thus, noise resulting from random coincidences in the spike times of individual neurons led to the high variability at episode onset and to the observed correlation pattern. This work further demonstrates that networks with widely different architectures, different cell types and different functions, all operate according to the same general mechanism early in their development.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanism for the universal pattern of activity in developing neuronal networks, Joel Tabak, Michael Mascagni, Richard Bertram, 2010, *Journal of Neurophysiology*, volume 103, 2208-2221.

This particular CellML version of the model has the A-type potassium current switched off. For the alternative model which has the A-type current switched on and the BK-type potassium current switched off (gBK=0.2). This CellML model runs in PCEnv and COR to replicate the published results (figure 2B). Please note that the model needs to be run for at least 3000ms to allow the model to reach stability.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations ~1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both I BK and I A could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. I BK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while I A could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that a heterogeneous distribution of fast K+ conductances could cause heterogeneous lactotroph firing patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Low dose of dopamine may stimulate prolactin secretion by increasing fast potassium currents, Joel Tabak, Natalia Toporikova, Marc E.

However despite their prevalance, they remain relatively poorly understood. Mathematical models, which capture the function of the beating human heart, play an important role in cardiac research. In part this is because practical experiments on human hearts are limited, and animal hearts may differ significantly in their anatomy and physiology relative to the human heart. In addition, cardiac arrhythmias are three dimensional phenomena, while experimental observations are mainly limited to surface recordings.\n\n\n\n\nExisting mathematical models of human ventricular cells include:\n\n\n\n* [Priebe and Beuckelmann, Electrophysiological Model of the Human Ventricular Myocyte, 1998](http://www.cellml.org/models/priebe_beuckelmann_1998_version01); and\n* [Bernus *et al.* A Computationally Efficient Electrophysiological Model of Human Ventricular Cells, 2002](http://www.cellml.org/models/bernus_wilders_zemlin_verschelde_panfilov_2002_version01).\n* \n\n\n\nHowever, these models have their limitations, such as the fact that several of the equations are based on animal data. The aim of the 2004 study by ten Tusscher *et al.*, is to develop a new model for human ventricular cells that is based on recent experimetnal data and that is computationally efficient for large-scale spatial simulations.

We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes.

The formalization of this process for computational modelling is facilitated by the use of accepted standards with which to describe and simulate models, ensuring consistency between the models and thus reducing the development and propagation of errors. CellML 1.1, an XML-based programming language, has been designed as a modelling standard which, by virtue of its import and grouping functions, facilitates model combination and reuse. Using CellML 1.1, we demonstrate the process of formalized model reuse by combining three separate models of rat cardiomyocyte function (an electrophysiology model, a model of cellular calcium dynamics and a mechanics model) which together make up the Pandit-Hinch-Niederer et al. cell model. Not only is this integrative model of rat electromechanics a useful tool for cardiac modelling but it is also an ideal framework with which to demonstrate both the power of model reuse and the challenges associated with this process.

The maximum step size must be constrained to be 0.001 weeks or smaller, or the software will ignore the pulsatile administration of gemcitabine. This model describes the response of tumor size to administration of gemcitabine, and was based off original Berkeley Madonna code provided by the model authors. \n \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: PURPOSE: This tumor response pharmacodynamic model aims to describe primary lesion shrinkage in non-small cell lung cancer over time and determine if concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine or that of its metabolites, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine or gemcitabine triphosphate, are better than gemcitabine dose for prediction of individual response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma gemcitabine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model. RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8 week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored doses of drug administered to patients.

We show that interactions between the oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute significance only. It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin infusion produce similar effects. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling the Insulin-Glucose Feedback System: The Significance of Pulsatile Insulin Secretion, Iva Marija Tolic, Erik Mosekilde and Jeppe Sturis, 2000, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 207, 361-375.

We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for thirteen ionic currents of USMCs: Ca2+ currents (L- and T-type), Na+ current, and hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated K+ currents, Ca2+ -activated K+ current,Ca2+ -activated Cl- current, non-specific cation current, Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger, Na+ -K+ pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area:volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular Ca2+ computed from known Ca2+ fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modelled in relation to the time constant of changing [Ca2+ ]i . This integrated model is validated by its reconstruction of the different action potential configurations of USMCs (spikes,plateau and bursts of spikes), the change from bursting to plateau type AP produced by estradiol, and of simultaneous experimental recordings of spontaneous AP, [Ca2+ ]i and phasic force. In summary, our advanced mathematical model provides a powerful tool to investigate the physiological ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of uterine electrical excitation-contraction coupling of labor and parturition. This will furnish the evolution of descriptive and predictive quantitative models of myometrial electrogenesis at the whole cell and tissue levels.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA computational model of the ionic currents, Ca2+ dynamics and action potentials underlying contraction of isolated uterine smooth muscle.

Near the end of term, APs vary in shape and size reflecting an ability to change the frequency, duration and amplitude of uterine contractions. A recent mathematical model ([PubMed ID: 21559514](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559514), [CellML model](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/263)) quantified several ionic features of the electrical excitability in uterine smooth muscle cells. It replicated many of the experimentally recorded uterine AP configurations but its limitations were evident when trying to simulate the long-duration bursting APs characteristic of labor. A computational parameter search suggested that delayed rectifying K+ currents could be a key model component requiring improvement to produce the longer-lasting bursting APs. Of the delayed rectifying K+ currents family it is of interest that KCNQ and hERG channels have been reported to be gestationally regulated in the uterus. These currents exhibit features similar to the broadly defined uterine IK1 of the original mathematical model. We thus formulated new quantitative descriptions for several IKCNQ and IhERG. Incorporation of these currents into the uterine cell model enabled simulations of the long-lasting bursting APs. Moreover, we used this modified model to simulate the effects of different contributions of IKCNQ and IhERG on AP form. Our findings suggest that the alterations in expression of hERG and KCNQ channels can potentially provide a mechanism for fine tuning of AP forms that lends a malleability for changing between plateau-like and long-lasting bursting-type APs as uterine cells prepare for parturition.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComputational modeling reveals key contributions of KCNQ and hERG currents to the malleability of uterine action potentials underpinning labor.

The primary variables of this system are beta-cell mass, plasma insulin concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. Existing mathematical models of glucose regulation incorporate only glucose and/or insulin dynamics. Here we develop a novel model of beta-cell mass, insulin, and glucose dynamics, which consists of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where glucose and insulin dynamics are fast relative to beta-cell mass dynamics. For normal parameter values, the model has two stable fixed points (representing physiological and pathological steady states), separated on a slow manifold by a saddle point. Mild hyperglycemia leads to the growth of the beta-cell mass (negative feedback) while extreme hyperglycemia leads to the reduction of the beta-cell mass (positive feedback). The model predicts that there are three pathways in prolonged hyperglycemia: (1) the physiological fixed point can be shifted to a hyperglycemic level (regulated hyperglycemia), (2) the physiological and saddle points can be eliminated (bifurcation), and (3) progressive defects in glucose and/or insulin dynamics can drive glucose levels up at a rate faster than the adaptation of the beta-cell mass which can drive glucose levels down (dynamical hyperglycemia).\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Model of Beta-cell Mass, Insulin, and Glucose Kinetics: Pathways to Diabetes, Brian Topp, Keith Promislow, Gerda de Vries, Robert M.

The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca(2+) and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca(2+)-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca(2+)/H(+) counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data. A thermodynamic investigation of the model indicates that the binding of MgATP has a large inhibitory effect on the maximal reverse rate of the pump. The model is suitable for integrating into whole-cell models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to simulate the effects on the cell of compromised metabolism arising in ischemia and hypoxia.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Thermodynamic Model of the Cardiac Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Ca(2+) (SERCA) Pump, Kenneth Tran, Nicolas P.

This is the control version of the experiment.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Drug biotransformation is one of the most important parameters of preclinical screening tests for the registration of new drug candidates. Conventional existing tests rely on nonhuman models which deliver an incomplete metabolic profile of drugs due to the lack of proper CYP450 expression as seen in human liver in vivo. In order to overcome this limitation, we used an organotypical model of human primary hepatocytes for the biotransformation of the drug diazepam with special reference to metabolites in both the cell matrix phase and supernatant and its interaction of three inducers (phenobarbital, dexamethasone, aroclor 1254) in different time responses (1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h). Phenobarbital showed the strongest inducing effect in generating desmethyldiazepam and induced up to a 150 fold increase in oxazepam-content which correlates with the increased availability of the precursor metabolites (temazepam and desmethyldiazepam). Aroclor 1254 and dexamethasone had the strongest inducing effect on temazepam and the second strongest on oxazepam. The strong and overlapping inductive role of phenobarbital strengthens the participation of CYP2B6 and CYP3A in diazepam N-demethylation and CYP3A in temazepam formation. Aroclor 1254 preferentially generated temazepam due to the interaction with CYP3A and potentially CYP2C19. In parallel we represented these data in the form of a mathematical model with two compartments explaining the dynamics of diazepam metabolism with the effect of these other inducers in human primary hepatocytes. The model consists of ten differential equations, with one for each concentration c(i,j) (i=diazepam, temazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, other metabolites) and one for each compartment (j= cell matrix phase, supernatant), respectively. The parameters p(k) (k=1, 2, 3, 4, 13) are rate constants describing the biotransformation of diazepam and its metabolites and the other parameters (k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) explain the concentration changes in the two compartments.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Two compartment model of diazepam biotransformation in an organotypical culture of primary human hepatocytes, Ali Acikgoz et al, 2009, *Toxicology and applied pharmacology*, 234, 179-191.

A mathematical model for the interactions of cdc2 and cyclin is constructed.

We associate the steady state with metaphase arrest in unfertilized eggs, the spontaneous oscillations with rapid division cycles in early embryos, and the excitable switch with growth-controlled division cycles typical of nonembryonic cells.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the cell division cycle: cdc2 and cyclin interactions, John J.

Analysis of this model shows that for phosphocreatine, creatine, and ATP the equilibrium assumption is an acceptable approximation with respect to their diffusion in the intracellular bulk water phase. However, the ADP concentration changes in the contraction cycle in a nonequilibrium workload-dependent manner, showing the existence of the intracellular concentration gradients. The model shows that workload-dependent alteration of ADP concentration in the compartmentalized creatine kinase system may be taken, together with the changes in P(i) concentration, to be among the major components of the metabolic feedback signal for regulation of respiration in muscle cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of mitochondrial respiration in heart cells analyzed by reaction-diffusion model of energy transfer, Marko Vendelin, Olav Kongas, and Valdur Saks, 2000, *American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology*, 278, C747-C764.

As computer performance and the computational efficiency of the models improve, clinical application of these heart mechanics models is becoming feasible. One such application is to estimate myocardial material properties by adjusting the constitutive parameters to match wall deformation from MRI or ultrasound measurements, together with a measurement (or estimate) of ventricular pressure. Pigs are now the principal large animal model for these studies and in this paper we present the development of a new three-dimensional finite element model of the heart based on measurements of the geometry and the fibre and sheet orientations of pig hearts. The end-diastolic deformation of the model is computed using the \"pole-zero\" constitutive law which we have previously used to model the mechanics of passive myocardial tissue specimens. The sensitivities of end-diastolic fibre-sheet material strains and heart shape to changes in the material parameters are computed for the parameters of the pole-zero law in order to assess the utility of the models for inverse material property determination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](per_pixel_texture_bump.jpg)\nThe rendered result of this model.\n\nTo launch the model, please select a model file under navigation on the right.\n\n\n\n\n",

Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these \"circuits\" at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. and Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267-268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of noise-resistance in genetic oscillators, Jose M.

As a consequence, every biochemical reaction in the cytoplasm has an associated proton stoichiometry that is generally noninteger- and pH-dependent. Therefore, with metabolic flux, pH is altered in a medium with finite buffer capacity. Apparent equilibrium constants and maximum enzyme velocities, which are functions of pH, are also altered. We augmented an earlier mathematical model of skeletal muscle glycogenolysis with pH-dependent enzyme kinetics and reaction equilibria to\ncompute the time course of pH changes. Analysis shows that kinetics and final equilibrium states of the closed system are highly constrained by the pH-dependent parameters. This kinetic model of glycogenolysis, coupled to creatine kinase and adenylate kinase, simulated published experiments made with a cell-free enzyme mixture to reconstitute the network and to synthesize PCr and lactate in vitro. Using the enzyme kinetic and thermodynamic data in the literature, the simulations required minimal adjustments of parameters to describe the data. These results show that incorporation of appropriate physical chemistry of the reactions with accurate kinetic modeling gives a reasonable simulation of experimental data and is necessary for a physically correct representation of the metabolic network. The approach is general for modeling metabolic networks beyond the specific pathway and conditions presented here.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDynamics of Muscle Glycogenolysis Modeled with pH Time Course Computation and pH-Dependent Reaction Equilibria and Enzyme Kinetics, Kalyan Vinnakota, Melissa L.

It runs in PCEnv, COR and OpenCell to reproduce the original matlab, provided by the model authors. The units are consistent throughout. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Rates of ATPase and glycolysis are several times faster in actively contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) than soleus (SOL), but we find these rates are not distinguishable at rest. We use a transient anoxic perturbation of steady state energy balance to decrease PCr reversibly and to measure the rates of ATPase and of lactate production without muscle activation or contraction. The rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis is less than the ATPase rate, accounting for the continual PCr decrease during anoxia in both muscles. We fit a mathematical model validated with properties of enzymes and solutes measured in vitro and appropriate for the transient perturbation of these muscles to experimental data to test whether the model accounts for the results. Simulations showed equal rates of ATPase and lactate production in both muscles. ATPase controls glycolytic flux by feedback from its products. Adenylate kinase function is critical because rise in [AMP] is necessary to activate glycogen phosphorylase. ATPase is the primary source of H+ production. The sum of contributions of the thirteen reactions of the glycogenolytic and glycolytic network to total proton load is negligible. The stoichiometry of lactate and H+ production is near unity. These results identify a default state of energy metabolism for resting muscle in which there is no difference in the metabolic phenotype of EDL and SOL. Therefore additional control mechanisms, involving higher ATPase flux and [Ca++], must exist to explain for the well-known difference in glycolytic rates in fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles in actively contracting muscle.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCommon Phenotype of Resting Mouse EDL and SOL Muscles: Equal ATPase and Glycolytic Flux During Transient Anoxia, Kalyan Vinnakota, Joshua Rusk, Lauren Palmer, Eric Shankland and Martin J.

The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of IKr and IKs on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of IKs density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced IKs (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of IKs activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, INaCa, secondary to Na+ accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of IKs:IKr density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).\n\n\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Effects of IKr and IKs heterogeneity on action potential duration and its rate dependence: a simulation study, Prakash C.

Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor initiates signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding kinetics. Interestingly, negative cooperative interactions are observed at high insulin concentrations while positive cooperativity may be present at low insulin concentrations. Clearly, insulin receptor binding kinetics cannot be simply explained by a classical bimolecular reaction. Mature insulin receptors have a dimeric structure capable of binding two molecules of insulin. The binding affinity of the receptor for the second insulin molecule is significantly lower than for the first bound insulin molecule. In addition, insulin receptor aggregation occurs in response to ligand binding and aggregation may also influence binding kinetics. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for insulin receptor binding kinetics that explicitly represents the divalent nature of the insulin receptor and incorporates receptor aggregation into the kinetic model. Model parameters are based upon published data where available. Computer simulations with our model are capable of reproducing both negative and positive cooperativity at the appropriate insulin concentrations. This model may be a useful tool for helping to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding and the coupling of receptor binding to downstream signaling events. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInsulin receptor binding kinetics: modeling and simulation studies, Sumanas Wanant and Michael J.

Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated cross-talk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from cross-talk, PI3K enhances Erk activation at points both upstream and downstream of Ras. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras/Erk activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Conceptual model of the PDGF receptor signaling network. Cross-talk interactions from PI3K lipid products (3' PIs) affect Ras-specific GEF (e.g. Grb2-Sos complex) recruitment and activation of MEK kinases, which might or might not be the same as those activated by Ras. It is recognized that those cross-talk effects might entail multiple steps, and that a more refined model would account for the effect of JNK activation on the MKP negative feedback loop. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nPI3K-dependent cross-talk interactions converge with Ras as quantifiable inputs integrated by Erk, Wang CC, Cirit M, and Haugh JM, 2009, *Molecular Systems Biology*, 5, article 246.

The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the Ca(2+) oscillations are mainly due to interaction of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump back into the ER, and the oscillations are prolonged by extracellular Ca(2+) entry that maintains the constant Ca(2+) supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca(2+) oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca(2+) oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca(2+)](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca(2+) oscillations in different types of cells.\n \n\n\n\n The original paper is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n A quantitative kinetic model for ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.

In this study, we investigated the effects of riluzole on ion currents in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs).

Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous beating in dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2.3 uM. Riluzole (10 uM) also effectively increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) which could be reversed by iberiotoxin (200 nM) and paxilline (1 uM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out patches, when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10 uM) increased BKCa-channel activity with a decrease in mean closed time. Simulation studies also unraveled that both decreased conductance of INa and increased conductance of IK(Ca) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in skeletal muscle cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action potentials and increase the repolarization of action potentials. Taken together, inhibition of INa and stimulation of BKCa-channel activity caused by this drug are partly, if not entirely, responsible for its muscle relaxant actions in clinical setting. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEffect of riluzole on action potential in cultured human skeletal muscle cells, Ya-Jean Wang, Ming-Wei Lin, An-An Lin, Sheng-Nan Wu, 2007, *Life Sciences*, 82, 11-20.

The model was also applied to simulate our experimental results obtained from chromaffin cells in the perfused rat adrenal medulla. Observed profiles of Ca(2+)responses induced by electrically stimulating the splanchnic nerve with various frequencies (1-50 Hz) were adequately simulated with minor readjustments of parameter values for Ca(2+)influx and extrusion. Secretory responses measured at the same time as the Ca(2+)responses were also simulated with consideration of a time constant to detect catecholamines in the experiment. Similarly, model simulations reproduced both Ca(2+)responses and secretory responses evoked by elevations of the extracellular K(+) concentration for different periods.

Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain calcium wave propagation: diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and diffusion of paracrine extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of airway epithelium to parametreize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a decreasing return on the radius of Ca2+ wave propagation is achieved as the amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore shown that for a Ca2+ wave to propagate large distances, a significant fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to be released. Further to this, the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional mechanism is important in Ca2+ wave propagation, such as regenerative release of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nMathematical modelling of calcium wave propagation in mammalian airway epithelium: evidence for regenerative ATP release, N.J.

The model has also been checked in COR and the units are consistent. This particular version of the model has alpha set to 0.5 and therefore it represents wound healing in a healthy individual (figure 2, left hand column).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nWounds in diabetic patients can take much longer to heal than they would in a healthy individual; some taking up to 18 months to heal properly. This suggests the normal wound healing process is disrupted in some way in diabetic patients, but despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying this process are still relatively poorly understood. However, by piecing together the information which has been obtained, it is possible to develop a simple mathematical model of the wound healing process and how it is influenced by diabetes. \n\n\n\n\nThe first stage of the wound healing process is inflammation, and macrophages are some of the first cells to be recruited to the site of injury. They are derived from monocytes and they differentiate into one of three types depending on the chemical stimulus they receive, namely; cytocidal (or killer), inflammatory, and repair macrophages. Killer macrophages remove bacteria and other debris from the wound site by phagocytosis, inflammatory macrophages secrete cytokines and chemokines to attract fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the wound and encourage their proliferation, while repair macrophages help to remodel the extracellular matrix of the wound. The ratio of inflammatory to repair macrophages seems to be a key determinant of the rate of wound healing. \n\n\n\n\nIn diabetic patients cell proliferation is often impaired, endothelial cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis, blood glucose levels are elevated, blood vessel growth is impaired, and there can be decreased collagen deposition at the wound site. Macrophage removal to the lymph nodes may also be impaired, which might explain the presence of macrophages at the wound site long after the inflammatory stage when they would have normally been cleared in a healthy individual. \n\n\n\n\nTo date, mathematical models of wound healing have tended to focus on the cell proliferation and repair stages of the wound process. However, in diabetic patients it seems the inflammatory phase should be modelled instead. In the paper described here, Helen Waugh and Jonathan Sherratt address this issue by developing a basic mathematical model of the inflammatory stage of the wound healing process, in particular focusing on the behaviour of the macrophage populations. This model is discussed in the context of the available biological data, and simulations are also used to suggest potential treatment strategies.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMacrophage dynamics in diabetic wound dealing, Helen V.

We would like to thank the author of the original model, Steven Webb, for making the original source code available to us.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nThe host immune response to a tumour can be divided into two basic, overlapping stages: the first is a phase of cell to cell recognition and interaction between the host lymphocytes and the target tumour cells, and this is followed by a stage of lymphocyte mediated killing of the tumour cells by apoptosis. However, in an evolutionary arms race between the host immune system and the tumour, some tumour cells have developed various strategies to evade both stages of the host immune response. \n\n\n\n\nOne of these strategies is for tumour cells to kill activated lymphocytes through their synthesis and secretion of the death ligand, FasL. This ligand binds to the death receptor Fas (also known as CD95) which is expressed on the surface of the activated lymphocytes, and this interaction triggers the apoptotic pathway in the lymphocyte. The binding of Fas and FasL can be controlled, at least in part, by the cleavage of FasL into a smaller, less cytotoxic, soluble form (sFasL) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). In addition, certain cells are able to secrete sFasL by alternate splicing of Fas mRNA transcripts. In combination, both these phenomena can lead to the down-regulation of the immune response. \n\n\n\n\nTumour-immune cell dynamics have been the subject of several theoretical studies. In the paper described here, Steven Webb, Jonathan Sherratt and Reginald Fish have developed a mathematical model of the Fas/FasL system to investigate Fas-FasL binding and the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis in the process of tumour-induced immunosupression. Model simulations demonstrate how the constitutive expression of FasL by tumour cells is a potential mechanism of immune evasion, and the model predicts that sFasL can act as an inhibitor of the Fas death signal. In addition the model considers the enzymatic cleavage of FasL into sFasL, and predicts that the inhibition of MMP cleavage activity causes Fas sensitive lymphocytes to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis faster than the Fas-resistant tumour cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations which represent the binding of Fas and FasL for each cell type. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic representation of the interactions between FasL, soluble FasL, and Fas receptor during an immune attack against a tumour cell. Cytotoxic T-cells recognize tumour cells, and are activated to express FasL. FasL then binds to Fas on the surface of the tumour cells and induces their death through apoptosis. Some tumour cells also express FasL, and T-cells express up-regulated Fas, probably because of activation in response to tumour antigen. This enables the tumour to counterattack the cytotoxic T-cells: FasL expressed on tumour cells binds to Fas on the T-cells, which then die by apoptosis before they can attack the tumour. FasL is cleaved by a MMP to produce the soluble form sFasL. This is functional, and may bind to Fas, forming membrane-bound sFasL/Fas complexes, which are quickly internalized. |\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Cells behaving badly: a theoretical model for the Fas/FasL system in tumour immunology](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHX-46HBR2D-3&_user=140507&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2002&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_cdi=6078&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=5bc281e567eb98631e8d4077ee0c9da1), Steven D.

The model incorporates two cell types (CD4+ T cells and a long-lived pool of cells), two strains of virus (drug-sensitive wild type and drug-resistant mutant) and two types of antiretroviral agents (reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors). The transient behavior of the cells and virus and the eventual eradication of the virus are determined primarily by the strength of the combination therapy against the mutant strain and the maximum achievable increase in the uninfected CD4+ T cell concentration. We also predict, if the parameters of the model remain constant during therapy, that less intensive maintenance regimens will be unable to maintain low viral loads for extensive periods of time. However, if the reduction in viral load produced by therapy reduces the state of activation of the immune system, the number of cells susceptible for HIV-1 infection may decrease even though total CD4+ T cells increase. Our model predicts that if this occurs strong inductive therapy that reduces viral load followed by weaker maintenance regimes may succeed.\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Schematic diagram of the model. |\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical analysis of antiretroviral therapy aimed at HIV-1 eradication or maintenance of low viral loads, Wein L, D'Amato R, Perelson A, 1998, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 192, 81-98.

Luminal proton secretion has been assigned to an H-K-ATPase, which has been represented by adapting the kinetic model of the gastric enzyme by Brzezinski et al. (P. Brzezinski, B. G. Malmstrom, P. Lorentzon, and B. Wallmark. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 942: 215-219, 1988). In shifting to a 2 H+:1 ATP stoichiometry, the model enzyme can acidify the tubule lumen approximately 3 pH units below that of the cytosol, when luminal K+ is in abundance. Peritubular base exit is a combination of ammonia recycling and HCO3- flux (either via Cl-/HCO3- exchange or via a Cl- channel). Ammonia recycling involves NH4(+) uptake on the Na-K-ATPase followed by diffusive NH3 exit [S. M. Wall. Am. J. Physiol. 270 (Renal Physiol. 39): F432-F439, 1996]; model calculations suggest that this is the principal mode of base exit. By virtue of this mechanism, the model also suggests that realistic elevations in peritubular K+ concentration will compromise IMCD acid secretion. Although ammonia recycling is insensitive to carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition, the base exit linked to HCO3- flux provides a CA-sensitive component to acid secretion. In model simulations, it is observed that increased luminal NaCl entry increases ammonia cycling but decreases peritubular Cl-/HCO3- exchange (due to increased cell Cl-). This parallel system of peritubular base exit stabilizes acid secretion in the face of variable Na+ reabsorption.\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical model of the inner medullary collecting duct of the rat: acid/base transport, Alan M.

It has been curated, the units are consistent and the model runs in COR and PCEnv to replicate the published results.\n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) has been developed, consisting of a-intercalated cells and a paracellular pathway, and which includes Na, K, Cl, HCO3, CO2, H2CO3, phosphate, ammonia, and urea. Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is mediated by both H-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H-ATPase, flux through the H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway. Peritubular HCO3 exit is via a conductive pathway and via the Cl/HCO3 exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees celcius in red blood cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996; Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1 or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant, including delivered HCO3 and HPO4, as well as peritubular NH3. Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total proton secretion by this tubule segment.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct of the rat, A.M.

The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and/or GAPDH activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and/or GAPDH activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Model of Phosphofructokinase and Glycolytic Oscillations in the Pancreatic Beta-cell, Pal O.

This file is known to run in PCEnv and COR, however the model works in milliseconds, and must be run for at least 600000 time units or more (to simulate 10 minutes) and could not be changed to portray minutes instead. Due to the large iterations, and large point density required to run the model, problems were found in PCEnv and COR where the model would crash or not display properly giving an memory exceded error. Current parameterization of the model replicates Figure 9 of the paper. The initial conditions for all variables were provided in the Bertram code (given as V=-66, n=0, c=0.17, ATP=2.4, ADP=0.05) however these figures still required a warmup period for the functions so they were changed by running the model to steady state then cloning to the output to better replicate the figures from the paper. \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nABSTRACT: The electrical activity of insulin-secreting pancreatic islets of Langerhans is characterized by bursts of action potentials. Most often this bursting is periodic, but in some cases it is modulated by an underlying slower rhythm. We suggest that the modulatory rhythm for this complex bursting pattern is due to oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some other slow process. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model of glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting in islets. We show that the combined model can reproduce several complex bursting patterns from mouse islets published in the literature, and we illustrate how these complex oscillations are produced through the use of a fast/slow analysis.\n\n\n\n Complex bursting in pancreatic islets: a potential glycolytic mechanism, Wierschem, Bertram, 2004, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*\n , 228, 513-521.

Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nHyperpolarization-Activated Graded Persistent Activity in the Prefrontal Cortex, Milena Winograd, Alain Destexhe, Maria V.

It is defined as an elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed so far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and the transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models are used to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological memory: the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between different pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting protection against reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an inferior pathogen species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen diversity memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under specific circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the presence of pathogen diversity. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of Immunological Memory and the Regulation of Competition between Pathogens, Dominik Wodarz, 2003, *Current Biology*, 13, 1648-1652.

The published paper contains four different mathematical models. This particular CellML model represents the first model - a simple model of autocatalytic virus spread via the division of infected CD4+ T cells.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Recent experimental data have shown that HIV-specific CD4 T cells provide a very important target for HIV replication. We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInfection dynamics in HIV-specific CD4 T cells: Does a CD4 T cell boost benefit the host or the virus?, Dominik Wodarz and Dean H.

At the same time, they can cause disease when induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That is, CTL expansion occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is in contrast to direct presentation where antigen is seen on the surface of the target cells (e.g. infected cells or tumor cells). Here we introduce a mathematical model, which takes the phenomenon of cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is implicit in the dynamics of the CTL: According to the model, the ability of a CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively high, CTL responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively low, tolerance is the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our results with respect to the idea of self/non-self discrimination and the danger signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer initiation, cancer evolution/progression, and therapeutic vaccination against cancers.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA dynamical perspective of CTL cross-priming and regulation: implications for cancer immunology, Dominik Wodarz and Vincent A.

The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients, specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory. Whether such treatment regimes would lead to long-term immunologic control deserves investigation under carefully controlled conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSpecific therapy regimes could lead to long-term immunological control of HIV, Dominik Wodarz and Martin A.

Recently, experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as \"CTL memory inflation\". In order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n Dynamics of killer T cell inflation in viral infections, Dominik Wodarz, Sophie Sierro and Paul Klenerman, 2007, *Journal of the Royal Society, Interface*, volume 4, issue 14, 533-543.

The core model comprises five components: susceptible host cells (x), free virus particles (v), early-infected cells (y0), late-infected cells (y1), and latently-infected cells (L). When susceptible host cells become infected with virus, the product cells are either productively infected or are latently infected. Productively infected cells can be divided into two subsets; those which express early-gene products and those which express late-gene products. The latter produce new free virus particles and the replication cycle is completed. Latently infected cells are initially silent but can become activated, giving rise to more productively infected cells. |\n\n\n\n",

The model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic parameter, the single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various process on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally.

Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic parameters, a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator.

The simulation consisted of a Ca transient, Ca association and dissociation rate constants of troponin C, and CB on and off rate constants. We evaluated sarcomere isometric twitch contractions at a constant muscle length. We assumed that each CB cycle hydrolyzes one ATP and that the force-length area (FLA) quantifies the total mechanical energy generated by CB cycles in a twitch contraction. FLA is a linear version of pressure-volume area, which quantifies the total mechanical energy of cardiac twitch contraction and correlates linearly with cardiac oxygen consumption (H. Suga, Physiol. Rev. 70: 247-277, 1990). The simulation shows that the contractile efficiency varies with changes in the Ca transient and Ca and CB kinetics except when they simultaneously speed up or slow down proportionally.

In this model four dynamic currents, the sodium current iNa, the slow inward current, is, the potassium current, iK, and the hyperpolarization-activated current, ih, in addition to a time-dependent leak current, i1 were included. The model simulated the spontaneous action potential the current voltage relationship, and the voltage clamp experiment in normal Tyrode solution of the rabbit S-A node. Furthermore, the changes of activity induced by the potassium current blocker Ba2+, by applying constant current, acetylcholine, and epinephrine were also reconstructed. It was strongly suggested that the pacemaker depolarization in the S-A node cell is mainly due to a gradual increase of iS during diastole, and that the contribution of iK is much less compared to the potassium current iK2 in the Purkinje fiber pacemaker depolarization. The rising phase of the action potential was due to iS and the plateau phase is determined by both the inactivation of iS and activation of iK.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nReconstruction of sino-atrial node pacemaker potential based on the voltage clamp experiments, K.

These models are primarily electrical, biochemical or mechanical in their orientation, and do not permit a full exploration of how the smooth muscle responds to electrical or mechanical forcing. To address this issue, we have developed a new model that consists of two major components: electrochemical and chemomechanical subsystem models of the smooth muscle cell. Included in the electrochemical model are models of the electrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and cytosolic Ca2+ buffering, particularly by calmodulin (CM). With this subsystem model, we can study the mechanics of the production of intracellular Ca2+ transient in response to membrane voltage clamp pulses. The chemomechanical model includes models of: (a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of phosphorylated (cycling) myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as attached (non-cycling) latch-type cross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to the contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the skeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested independently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell model responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic conditions are calculated and compared with measured single cell length-force and force-velocity data obtained from literature. This integrated cell model provides biophysically based explanations of electrical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena in cerebrovascular smooth muscle, and has considerable utility as an adjunct to laboratory research and experimental design.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nThe myogenic response in isolated rat cerebrovascular arteries: smooth muscle cell model, Jin Yang, John W.

Considering the extreme inter-individual variability of absorption and metabolism of methadone, population-based PK would be useful to provide insight into the relationship between dose, blood concentrations, and clinical effects of methadone. To address this need, an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been constructed to systematically study methadone metabolism and PK. The model will facilitate the design of cost-effective studies that will evaluate methadone PK and PD relationships, and may be useful to guide methadone dosing in children. The PBPK model, which includes whole-body multi-organ distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism, and clearance, is parameterized based on a database of pediatric PK parameters and data collected from clinical experiments. The model is further tailored and verified based on PK data from individual adults, then scaled appropriately to apply to children aged 0-24 months. Based on measured variability in CYP3A enzyme expression levels and plasma orosomucoid (ORM2) concentrations, a Monte-Carlo-based simulation of methadone kinetics in a pediatric population was performed. The simulation predicts extreme variability in plasma concentrations and clearance kinetics for methadone in the pediatric population, based on standard dosing protocols. In addition, it is shown that when doses are designed for individuals based on prior protein expression information, inter-individual variability in methadone kinetics may be greatly reduced. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nPopulation-based analysis of methadone distribution and metabolism using an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, Feng Yang, Xianping Tong, D.

Animal experiments have shown that PVA is correlated linearly with the ventricular oxygen consumption (Vo2) per beat under a variety of loading conditions in a stable contractile state. The slope of the Vo2-PVA line has been shown to remain constant in different contractile states, implying a constant stoichiometry between Vo2 and PVA. As a first step to understand the nature of this Vo2-PVA relation, we devised a new crossbridge (CB) model to theoretically relate PVA with the total enthalpy change associated with the ATP hydrolysis for all CB cycles. One of the most important assumptions on which this model analysis depended was that the time-varying elasticity model could simulate the instantaneous pressure-volume relation. The result of this analysis implied that the empirical linear Vo2-PVA relation could be attributed to the energy balance between energy input and output of the chemomechanical transduction associated with CB cycles during a ventricular contraction. \n\n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Crossbridge Model Compatible with the Linear Relationship between Left Ventricular Oxygen Consumption and Pressure-Volume Area, Yoshio Yasumura, Hiroyuki Suga, 1988, *Japanese Heart Journal*, 29, 335-347, [PubMed ID: 3172477](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/3172477).\n \n\n\n\n",

The units are consistent and the original source code was used to fix the CellML model such that it now runs to recreate the published results. The original paper contains three different mathematical models and this particular CellML model represents the first model of self-renewing memory CD4+ T cell homeostasis in the absence of HIV infection.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The asymptomatic phase of HIV infection is characterised by a slow decline of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells. Why this decline is slow is not understood. One potential explanation is that the low average rate of homeostatic proliferation or immune activation dictates the pace of a \"runaway\" decline of memory CD4(+) T cells, in which activation drives infection, higher viral loads, more recruitment of cells into an activated state, and further infection events. We explore this hypothesis using mathematical models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using simple mathematical models of the dynamics of T cell homeostasis and proliferation, we find that this mechanism fails to explain the time scale of CD4(+) memory T cell loss. Instead it predicts the rapid attainment of a stable set point, so other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the slow decline in CD4(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: A runaway cycle in which elevated CD4(+) T cell activation and proliferation drive HIV production and vice versa cannot explain the pace of depletion during chronic HIV infection. We summarize some alternative mechanisms by which the CD4(+) memory T cell homeostatic set point might slowly diminish. While none are mutually exclusive, the phenomenon of viral rebound, in which interruption of antiretroviral therapy causes a rapid return to pretreatment viral load and T cell counts, supports the model of virus adaptation as a major force driving depletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| A simple model of self-renewing memory CD4+ T cell homeostasis in the absence of HIV infection, with density-dependent rates of division (a and r), and death of resting cells (delta). d2 represents the rate of death of the dividing cells. |\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the slow depletion of memory CD4+ T cells in HIV infection, Andrew Yates, Jaroslav Stark, Nigel Klein, Rustom Antia, and Robin Callard, 2007, *PLoS Medicine*, volume 4, issue 5, 948-955.

For both hypoxia and ischemia, depriving the tissue of oxygen causes cells to switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. This results in reduced ATP synthesis, which in turn decreases the effectiveness of the cell membrane ion pumps, especially the Na-K-ATPase pump. Additionally, in the case of ischemia, reduced blood flow has the effect of reducing the tissue's supply of metabolic substrates, and it also reduces the efficiency of waste product removal. \n\n\n\n\nIschemia and hypoxia have been experimentally studied in a wide variety of species and different tissue types. Tissue responses to ischemia include swelling of the intracellular space, shrinkage of the extracellular space, and an increase in the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e). In neural tissue, this increase in extracellular potassium concentration occurs in two stages; an initial rapid increase from about 5 mM to 55 mM, followed by a slower increase up to 80 mM. In cardiac myocytes, there are generally three phases observed: a rapid increase, a relative plateau, and a second, slower increase. These increases in extracellular potassium concentration may have important pathological consequences. For example, in cardiac ischemia, the increased [K+]e may cause arrhythmias.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Chung-Seon Yi, Aaron L. Fogelson, James P. Keener, and Charles S. Peskin studied the possible mechanisms underlying extracellular potassium accumulation during ischemia. They developed a simple Hodgkin-Huxley type ionic model, which unlike other previously published models of cardiac myocytes, includes extracellular volume, capillary flow and the influence of nearby healthy tissue as variables (see figure 1 and figure 2 below). The model describes events in a tissue consisting of a collection of homogeneous cells subject to ischemia or hypoxia, a homogeneous extracellular space surrounding three cells, a capillary compartment representing the vasculature for this piece of tissue, and another compartment corresponding to the healthy tissue surrounding the ischemic or hypoxic tissue. The first three compartments combine to form the damaged tissue. \n\n\n\n\nModel simulations produce a response to ischemia similar to that seen in neural tissue, and the mechanisms underlying this process in the model is elucidated. However, Yi *et al.* found that the same underlying mechanism is not present in the cardiac ion model, and they suggest that this difference may explain the qualitative difference in response observed in cardiac tissue.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[A Mathematical Study of Volume Shifts and Ionic Concentration Changes during Ischemia and Hypoxia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMD-4789XHH-8&_user=140507&_coverDate=01%2F07%2F2003&_rdoc=8&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%236932%232003%23997799998%23365817!&_cdi=6932&_sort=d&_docanchor=&wchp=dGLbVzz-lSztz&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=d49670d50ea95b76f07fd616d782751a), Chung-Seon Yi, Aaron L.

More importantly, it appears it has been coded to conform with procedural matlab code, and even if the above errors were fixed, other problems would likely persist. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nABSTRACT: Two distinct delayed rectifier K+ currents, IKr and IKs, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier K+ current in the model was replaced by IKr and IKs. Our results show that IKs is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either IKr or IKs can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of IKr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, > 80% block of IKs results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high IKs-to-IKr density ratio (approximately 8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, IKr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of IKs to IKr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both IKr and IKs is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (ICa) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of IKr and IKs; it increases when the IKr-to-IKs density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i. This in turn causes different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of ICa and different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent conductance of IKs at very long DIs (> 5 s) for different BCLs. This BCL dependence of ICa and IKs that is secondary to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a \"memory property\" of cardiac cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nTwo Components of the Delayed Rectifier K+ Current in Ventricular Myocytes of the Guinea Pig Type, Jinglin Zeng, Kenneth R.
